    "### Was ist ein API?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **I**nterface (Benutzeroberfläche): Interaktion zwischen Mensch und Computer, um bestimmte Aufgaben zu erledigen, ohne dass er verstehen muss, wie diese Aufgabe tatsächlich ausgeführt wird.  \n",
    "- Wie Benutzeroberflächen machen APIs schwierige Dinge einfacher, indem sie eine Menge von Prozessen auf niedriger Ebene abstrahieren. APIs bündeln Funktionen damit diese besonders leicht zu verstehen und zu verwenden sind.\n",
    "\n",
    "### RESTful APIs\n",
    "- Besondere Art von APIs, die auf dem REST (Representational State Transfer) Prinzip basieren.\n",
    "- RESTful APIs ermöglichen die Kommunikation und den Datenaustausch zwischen verschiedenen Anwendungen über das Internet.\n",
    "- RESTful APIs arbeiten nach dem Client-Server-Modell, wobei der Client Anfragen (Requests) an den Server sendet und der Server entsprechend antwortet.\n",
    "- Die Daten werden normalerweise im JSON- oder XML-Format übertragen.\n",
    "- RESTful APIs sind zustandslos, was bedeutet, dass jede Anfrage unabhängig ist und der Server keine Informationen über vergangene Anfragen speichert.\n",
    "- Zugriff über Endpunkte (Endpoints)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Requests mit Python\n",
    "- Requests werden an einen bestimmten Endpunkt (Endpoint) gesendet in Form einer URL (APIs können verschiedene Enpoints haben!)\n",
    "- Diese URL besteht aus verschiedenen Teilen, die wir so spezifizieren können (Suchbegriffe, Filter, Parameter etc.), sodass wir den gewünschten Inhalt zurück bekommen.\n",
    "- Die meisten APIs haben *rate limits*, also Obergrenzen für Anfragen in einer bestimmten Zeitspanne. \n",
    "\n",
    "### API keys oder tokens\n",
    "- Um Anfragen an einen API zu senden, benötigen wir in den meisten Fällen einen API key oder API token.\n",
    "- API keys oder tokens funktionieren wie Benutzername und Passwort die uns identifizieren.\n",
    "- Diese keys können auf der jeweiligen Webseite des APIs beantragt werden und werden uns dann zugewiesen.\n",
    "- Es ist wichtig, dass wir diese Zugangsdaten nicht teilen, das heißt auch nicht direkt in unser Script schreiben.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Responses\n",
    "- Wenn wir eine GET-Anfrage an den API senden, bekommen wir im Gegenzug eine Antwort (response)\n",
    "- In den meisten Fällen bekommen wir die Daten im `json`-Format zurück. Das steht für *JavaScript Object Notation*.\n",
    "- `json` ist eine genestete Datenstruktur, die aussieht wie ein *dictionary* in Python und in der die Daten in *key-value* Paaren gespeichert sind.\n",
    "- Mit dem Python Paket `json` können wir diese Datenstrukturen wie ein `dictionary` behandeln.\n",
    "- Mit `pandas` Methode `.read_json()` können wir dieses Datenformat auch direkt in einen Dataframe umwandeln."

    "2. Der tags-Endpunkt liefert API-Tags für mehr als 50.000 Ergebnisse, die in anderen API-Abfragen verwendet werden können. \n",
    "3. Der sections-Emdpunkt liefert Informationen über die Gruppierung veröffentlichter Artikel in Sektionen. \n",
    "4. Der editions-Endpunkt liefert Inhalte für jede der regionalen Hauptseiten: USA UK, Australien und International. \n",

       "   'body': '<p>If only the Germans had a word for “zeitgeist”. There’s a football tournament starting here on Friday, not that you would necessarily know it. Indeed, from a cursory trawl of Thursday’s media what was most striking of all was the absence of Euros-buzz, the suspicion that there are bigger priorities out there. “CANCER,” screamed the front page of <em>Bild</em>, just in case you were thinking of getting too excited. Chancellor Olaf Scholz is missing the opening game to attend the G7 in Italy. The sports bulletins were dominated by the sudden resignation of the Borussia Dortmund coach, Edin Terzic. On the Kicker website, the first Euro 2024 news appeared some way below a story about RB Leipzig’s summer transfer business.</p> <p>None of which should necessarily be mistaken for pure apathy. Rather, there is a more complex melange of emotions at work here. Euro 2024 is still very much present, as long as you know where to look: the big town squares where overseas fans have begun to congregate, the television ad breaks where Joshua Kimmich is shaving his chin baby-smooth with a next-generation razor.

This is a public burned by past failures, who pledge primary loyalty to their club teams, who above all are wary of overcommiting too early. When even the great Toni Kroos lists France, Portugal and England as his three favourites, with the host nation in the chase group just behind, the attempt at expectation management is clear enough. Germany is not all-in on this team yet. By 11pm on Friday night, that could very well have changed.</p> <p>Through history, Germany’s campaigns have often thrived or foundered on their opening game. Each of their seven previous tournament victories began with a win; indeed, Germany have never failed to reach the quarter-finals after winning their first game. Even now, Philipp Lahm is best remembered as the man whose curling shot against Costa Rica started the euphoria machine that was the 2006 World Cup.</p> <p>By contrast, each of Germany’s past three tournaments has begun with a momentum-crushing defeat: to Mexico in 2018, France in 2021 and Japan in 2022. Lose to Scotland in Munich on Friday, and all of a sudden Sommermärchen 2.0 will take on a vividly different shade. “The first match is very, very&nbsp;important,” Kroos said earlier this week. “The last few tournaments have shown that in a negative way.”</p>    <p>One of the ironies of Germany’s slump at international level over recent years is that it has coincided with a rich vein of form for German clubs in Europe. Bayern won the Champions League in 2020; Eintracht Frankfurt the Europa League in 2022; Borussia Dortmund made this year’s Champions League final; Bayer Leverkusen were the best team in the world for large parts of this season, surrendering their unbeaten record only in their penultimate game, the Europa League final against Atalanta.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the likes of Kroos, Antonio Rüdiger and Ilkay Gündogan have won practically everything there is to win at club level. Point being: this is a squad that knows how to rise to the big occasion. The issue, of late, has been doing so in tandem.</p> <p>But over the short invigorating months under Julian Nagelsmann, the pieces have slowly come together. Rüdiger and Jonathan Tah have forged a strong partnership at the heart of defence, solving one of Germany’s longstanding issues at a stroke. “It just works,” Rüdiger said recently. Kimmich at right-back will have the job of dealing with the overlapping Andrew Robertson. On the opposite flank Maximilian Mittelstädt, who has had a breakout&nbsp;season with Stuttgart, provides an underrated attacking threat of his&nbsp;own.</p> <p>Gündogan and Kroos, with Robert Andrich behind them, form a midfield to envy any in the tournament. The return of the all-conquering Kroos offers this team not just an unerring passing game and a champion mentality, but a certain sense of mission: an opportunity to elevate their teammate into the pantheon occupied by generational greats like&nbsp;Xavi, Andrés Iniesta and Zinedine Zidane who won everything there was to win, who essentially completed football. Then you have the front three, with&nbsp;Florian Wirtz and Jamal Musiala providing the creativity and Kai Havertz the cutting edge up front. Niclas Füllkrug, Leroy Sané and Thomas Müller are more likely to make an impact from the bench but could feature more extensively&nbsp;later.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/jun/13/germany-and-nagelsmann-still-trying-to-solve-their-ilkay-gundogan-puzzle\">Germany and Nagelsmann still trying to solve their Ilkay Gündogan puzzle</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This is, by any measure, a team capable of challenging. In fact, pretty much the only genuine selection dilemma for Nagelsmann is in what has traditionally been the strongest position of all. “We don’t need a discussion about our goalkeeper,” the sporting director, Rudi Völler, said this week. Yep, good luck with that. In reality the mistake by Manuel Neuer in the recent friendly against Greece – the latest in a string of errors by the 38-year-old – has reopened the debate over the No&nbsp;1 shirt. In any other era Marc-André ter Stegen would probably have 120 caps rather than the 40 he has managed to scrape together in Neuer’s shadow. Neuer will start the tournament, but is by no means guaranteed to finish it.</p> <p>All of which has unfolded against the backdrop of a certain cautious optimism, with the emphasis on caution. This is perhaps the first tournament for a generation where Germans are bearish rather than bullish on their chances: analogous in many ways to England in 2018, driven to cynicism by one too many tournament fiascos.</p> <p>The fervour and focus of a home crowd can drive teams to places they never thought they could go, make them feel irresistible, make opponents feel peripheral. In a tournament stacked with contenders, Germany will need&nbsp;that&nbsp;surge of sentiment to push them&nbsp;over the line. Friday night offers their first chance – and perhaps their last – to convert doubters into believers.</p>',\n",

Like Karani, who was born in Germany, most Turkish Germans trace their ancestry to the <em>Gastarbeiter</em> (guest worker) movement of the 1960s and 70s.</p> <p>As a result, after the host nation Germany, no other European Championship participant will receive as much support as Turkey. The elation with which the Turkish national team was greeted last week during its public training session at its base in Barsinghausen, Lower Saxony, gave something of a foretaste of the reception the team is likely to receive in Dortmund on Tuesday evening, followed four days later there against Portugal and on 26 June against the Czech Republic in Hamburg.</p> <p>Some who failed to get tickets clambered up into the tree tops hoping for a glance into the training ground. They cheered Vincenzo Montella’s team with flags, homemade placards and cries of “Türkiye, Türkiye”. Many were already in national team kit or wore the shirts of their favourite Istanbul clubs. They hovered on the sidelines hoping for autographs or selfies with the stars, such as Real Madrid’s Arda Guler, Borussia Dortmund’s Salih Ozcan and the captain, Hakan Calhanoglu.</p>    <p>“We really feel at home when we’re in Germany,” the attacking midfielder, Yusuf Yazici, told journalists on the sidelines. “It’s like having your nation accompany you, such was the enthusiasm, and we’re all very happy to see them wherever we go.”</p> <p>Ozgur Ozvatan, a political scientist and sociologist at the Berlin Institute for Empirical Research on Integration and Migration says a <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/match/_/gameId/688956/turkey-germany\">friendly between Turkey and Germany</a> last November showed just how much potential there is for the Turkish fan scene to be politicised, driven in no small part by the nationalist momentum behind Turkey’s president Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who was visiting Germany at the time. But he says, around this championship, there is much to suggest that pure unalloyed emotion is the factor motivating most fans.</p> <p>“If you look at the sense of delight, it seems to be something that is less political and rather more to do with joy and euphoria that the Turkish national team is in Germany, and that those who support Turkey in Germany have the feeling that they are the hosts for this national team,” he said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/jun/14/euro-2024-team-guides-part-24-turkey\">Euro 2024 team guides part 24: Turkey</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Tugsal Mogul, theatre director, anaesthetist and football fan, who has supported Borussia Mönchengladbach all his life, has brought to the stage his mixed feelings about the internal strife he has often felt when urged to support either Turkey or Germany. <em><a href=\"https://staatstheater-hannover.de/de_DE/programm/unsere-elf.1343726\">Unsere Elf</a></em> (Our Eleven – A Somewhat Alternative National Anthem), which is playing at Hanover’s Staatstheater as part of the cultural programme around the Euros, explores racism, integration, migration and right-wing extremism, issues that have often been inextricably tied up with the game.</p> <p>As a child of Turkish migrants who was born in Germany’s industrial heartland of North Rhein Westphalia, Mogul says he often felt at a distance from Germany’s national team. “For years I wanted Germany to lose,” he said. “I was born here, my mother tongue is German, but I just could not identify with this team for a very long time.”</p> <p>The so-called <em>Sommermärchen</em> (summer fairytale) of 2006, when Germany hosted the World Cup and for a few short weeks, all seemed well with the world, was an experience he shared, but only to a certain extent. “It was the best of summers. I very much warmed to the German team. It was more diverse, more different than it had ever been. Sports-wise also on another level,” Mogul says.</p> <p>But it was also the height of what were initially dismissed as the “Kebab murders”, a string of racist killings by a neo-Nazi terrorist group, the NSU, the main targets of which were ethnic Turks, but who were long under suspicion by authorities of having carried out the attacks among themselves. “This image of the <em>Sommermärchen</em>, of a perfect world, a land without racism – it wasn’t quite correct. I remember seeing all the Germany flags at the windows, and feeling both appalled and happy,” he said.</p> <p>By 2014, captivated by none other than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/nov/15/mesut-ozil-turkish-german-football\">Mesut Özil</a>, “his legs, his style of play,” Mogul brought his first Germany shirt. “In Turkey,” he says with a chuckle. That dream also famously <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/mar/24/an-ode-to-mesut-ozil-the-frictionless-footballer-not-designed-for-the-age-of-rage\">turned sour</a>. Özil, widely considered one of Germany’s best players, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jul/22/mesut-ozil-retires-german-national-team-discrimination\">resigned from the national team</a> in 2018 citing discrimination, stating: “I am German when we win, but I am an immigrant when we lose”. In some ways the affair still overshadows the national team and to this day calls into question its claim to be a motor for integration.</p>    <p>Ozvatan, the political scientist, himself a former professional footballer, said that while he believed Özil was responsible for his own views, the German football federation (DFB) did not do itself proud in the way it dealt with his claim. He also talked about a poll from the recent <a href=\"https://presse.wdr.de/plounge/wdr/programm/2024/06/20240602_einigkeit_recht_vielfalt.html\">documentary by Philipp Awounou</a>, in which 21% of respondents said they agreed with the statement: “I would prefer it if more white players played in the German national team again”.</p> <p>“The reaction of the national team coach [Julian Nagelsmann] was to say: it was a shit poll, instead of saying: ‘This is a problem in Germany and we need to deal with it,’” Ozvatan says. “But these things cannot just be brushed under the carpet”.</p> <p>Mogul said despite some strife, there is much to be proud of in both Turkey and Germany’s teams, including Ilkay Gundogan, the grandson of a Turkish <em>gastarbeiter</em>, captaining the German team. For the opening game the TV camera seemed to linger on him a little longer than on anyone else, perhaps to see if he knew the words of the national anthem. (He did.)</p> <p>On the Kurfürstendamm boulevard, following Germany’s 5-1 win against Scotland on Friday night, a group of young German-Turks stood on the side of the road cheering as a constant stream of cars bearing German flags drove by, honking their horns in celebration. “We’re really happy that Germany won,” Adem, 18, said. “And I would also like to feel the same warmth from the Germans towards Turkey if and when we win.”</p>',\n",

Of course you are. It’s been 13 long summer days since Real Madrid won the Champions League final, but the wait is almost over. We’re about to break the seal on a 30-day football buffet, where the games and goals will just keep piling up. You tell yourself that you <em>might</em> skip Poland v Austria next Friday, but you know you won’t.</p> <p>We’re all in, and if the trophy belongs to the players and the tournament belongs to the fans who will criss-cross between Germany’s great football cathedrals, then maybe this moment belongs to us, the armchair fans. The simple joy of a big summer tournament feels like an increasingly rare treat, so let’s savour the moment.</p> <p>Tonight’s opener, pencilled in the diary ever since the draw in early December, feels like a perfect first act. It pits the hosts, among the favourites but still not quite finding that elusive extra gear, against perennial underdogs in Scotland. Steve Clarke’s side appear to have slipped backwards since their exceptional qualifying campaign, drifting from dark horses to outsiders in a tricky Group A.</p> <p>That said, if you have to play Germany in Germany, this is the time to do it – when rustiness and first-night nerves could really play a part. All the pressure is on the hosts tonight, and the longer Scotland can keep them at bay, the greater the tension inside the, er, Munich Football Arena. There lies the path to a shock victory – and if you can’t dream now, when can you?</p> <p>Kick-off is at 9pm local time, 8pm BST and we’ll have all the buildup, team news and coverage of the opening ceremony. <em>Auf geht’s!</em></p> </div>   </div>',\n",

They say you should never do it, but we just have because today Euro 2024 Daily is channeling its inner William Wallace and is – for one day only – happy to do so. In the run-up to Friday’s eagerly awaited curtain-raiser between the hosts and Steve Clarke’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/jun/14/fear-of-missing-out-scotland-fans-arrive-munich\">travelling Tartan Army</a>, you find us buzzing on Buckie and basking in the sense of enormous wellbeing generated by the sight and screeching sounds of that bevvied-up pipe and drum band who went viral courtesy of their march on Munich’s Marienplatz from Odeonsplatz on Thursday. OK, so they may not have been as viewed as often as that tired and emotional lone bagpiper who went bahoochie-over-brogues off the edge of a München restaurant booth without so much as missing a note as he crashed down, but if the team can maintain similar composure in the face of extreme adversity, who’s to say they won’t get a result?</p> <p>The omens are good. Or bad, depending on your point of view. In the 11 major tournaments they have – and Euro 2024 Daily uses this term advisedly – <em>contested</em>, Scotland have won just three times. One of those came against the footballing stronghold of New Zealand, while the others were at the expense of Yugoslavia and Zaire, two nations of whom our younger reader may genuinely never have heard. Scotland have also failed to win any of their opening games in any of their last six tournaments, while the most recent Scottish international to score a goal at a major competition on foreign soil <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/jun/12/craig-burley-warns-scotland-before-euro-2024-opener\">is Craig Burley</a>, who is aged 52. What’s more, in five competitive matches against Germany, Scotland have never won once, so while a pessimist might point out that both history and the odds <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/jun/13/we-have-everything-nagelsmann-talks-up-germany-before-scotland-opener\">are stacked against them</a>, someone who views their glass of Irn-Bru as being more half-full would argue that their time has finally come.</p> <p>In what is ostensibly a free hit for Clarke’s side before far easier – but still difficult – assignments to come, any kind of positive result would provide a rock-solid platform from which Scotland could subsequently catapult themselves into the knockout stages of a major tournament <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/jun/13/scotland-get-serious-as-steve-clarkes-men-eye-their-chance-to-make-history\">for the first time in their history</a>. “We want to make history,” <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/jun/13/prospect-of-becoming-legends-drives-us-says-scotlands-andy-robertson\">roared Andy Robertson</a>, who will lead his side into battle. “We have so many incentives here, but becoming a legendary squad is the biggest. That’s what has to drive us forward. The thought of being the first Scotland team to make a knockout round is our driving force. If we manage that? You just never know.”</p> <p>Well, you have a pretty good idea, but now is not the time to dwell on negatives, not least when everybody’s favourite fitba pundit, Ally McCoist, is brimful of optimism after getting his monster riffola on in the mosh pit of AC/DC’s gig at Munich’s Olympiastadion on Tuesday night. “The Germany game is a great game for us because it’s the opening game,” he tooted on TalkSport. “Germany have obviously had a bit of form and 100% they’ll be deservedly favourites – but it’s a good game for us to open with.” Top of the bill alongside Germany for Friday’s showdown at the Allianz Arena [Munich Football Arena, actually – Uefa Lawyers]<em>,</em> a win for Scotland would give them the momentum of a Rock N Roll Train and guarantee that their boisterous and good-humoured travelling fans shake the Bavarian capital all night long.</p> <h2><strong>LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE</strong></h2> <p>Join Niall McVeigh from 6pm for hot coverage of the Euro 2024 opening ceremony, followed by minute-by-minute updates from Germany 0-0 Scotland.</p> <h2><strong>QUOTE OF THE DAY</strong></h2> <p>“It started as a joke – hang a ball sprayed with text in a tree. The neighbours liked it, we liked it and now every two years we’re up in the scaffolding and cherry pickers to decorate the street” – Danny van Dijk, one of the driving forces behind decorations in the Marktweg, one of several roads in the Netherlands that gets an <em>oranje</em> facelift during Euros and World Cups, with a whopping 40 miles of bunting on display.</p>      <h2><strong>FOOTBALL DAILY LETTERS</strong></h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Watching from the other side of the Atlantic, I am always fascinated how England enter every major tournament with an enthusiastic: ‘It’s coming home!’ Even though it is quite clear that football has read Thomas Wolfe and knows that it can’t go home again” – Pat Condreay.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I don’t understand why Steve Malone is down about Wales failing to qualify for the Euros (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/jun/13/football-daily-email-euro-2004\">yesterday’s Football Daily letters</a>). I was quite persuaded by your analysis that none of the participants will hoist the trophy. So, a la Denmark in 1992, wouldn’t the organisers look to the last eliminated, non-qualifying nation to step up? Yup, Wales to win by default (maybe jointly with fellow playoff losers Iceland and Greece). Be proud, lads” – Mike Wilner.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I’m guessing Djinkin’ Djibril Cissé couldn’t bag himself any punditry work for the Euros. This would explain why he’s <a href=\"https://republic-corner.fr/?page_id=433\">doing a DJ set</a> at a trendy nightspot near me in Poitiers on the night of the first round-of-16 fixtures” – Ian France.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>So the animal prediction business has started already – an orangutan struggling to definitively choose between Germany and Scotland (yesterday’s News, Bits and Bobs, full email edition). The trouble with these things is that the choices are too limited: rather than just two bowls of food or whatever, there should be 24, weighted according to the probability of success. So France, at betting odds of 4-1, get a quarter-size bowl, while Albania at 500-1 get, er, one 500th of a bowl. Unfortunately that will make some bowls rather too small to see; we’ll need something with good eyesight – say, an osprey, or a bald eagle? The orangutan can be shifted on to UK general election duties, which looks somewhat easier to predict” – Charles Antaki.</p> </blockquote> <p><em>Send letters to <a href=\"mailto:the.boss@theguardian.com?utm_term=665dcebdaf7c30f2df2b72f8f4b694f2&amp;utm_campaign=TheFiver&amp;utm_source=esp&amp;utm_medium=Email&amp;CMP=fiver_email&amp;utm_term=665f315548bfde39636df5e04692c01d&amp;utm_campaign=TheFiver&amp;utm_source=esp&amp;utm_medium=Email&amp;CMP=fiver_email&amp;utm_term=666080f73692ab47041ba59b8dd2163f&amp;utm_campaign=TheFiver&amp;utm_source=esp&amp;utm_medium=Email&amp;CMP=fiver_email&amp;utm_term=66631bc31ecb59738269c2977414484f&amp;utm_campaign=TheFiver&amp;utm_source=esp&amp;utm_medium=Email&amp;CMP=fiver_email\">the.boss@theguardian.com</a>. <strong>Today’s letter o’ the day winner is … Charles Antaki, who wins our final copy of <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Euro-88-Football-European-Championship/dp/1801507201\">Euro 88: The Football Purists’ European Championship</a>, by Pitch Publishing.

       "   'body': '<p>Sometimes, in an effort to mix things up towards the end of Germany’s training sessions, Julian Nagelsmann cooks up a clash of generations. The more youthful half of his unit contest a match against their seniors and it is, in the manager’s words, “always a hard fight”. Neither team consistently holds sway over the other and any battle lines are purely cosmetic. “To have a good mix is really positive,” he said. “The mood in our camp is excellent and the connection between the younger and older players is really good.”</p> <p>Germany’s blend clicked <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/jun/15/kai-havertz-more-to-come-euro-2024-germany-scotland\">to delightful effect against Scotland</a>. Their youngest players, the 21-year-olds Jamal Musiala and Florian Wirtz, scored fine goals and&nbsp;were given their platform by&nbsp;an experienced base like no other. Given their speed and verve it is a surprise to note that Germany have the highest average age at Euro&nbsp;2024; it is even more of an eye-opener that, should they lift the trophy in Berlin next month, they will be the oldest European champions in the tournament’s&nbsp;history.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/jun/18/turkey-georgia-euro-2024-group-f-match-report\">Arda Guler brings the thunder as Turkey survive storm to beat Georgia</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“We have to find some solutions for the future,” Nagelsmann said, clearly aware that the present finely balanced setup will probably not even survive into the next World Cup. “But for the tournament we’re in now, it’s the perfect mix and we can be very successful.”</p> <p>A win against Hungary in Stuttgart, guaranteeing a place in the last 16 with a game to spare, would heighten that impression. Nagelsmann will name the same side that thrashed Scotland: why tinker when, bar a freakish own goal from Antonio Rüdiger, their performance had been virtually perfect? The spine will comprise four thirtysomethings: Rüdiger, Manuel Neuer, Toni Kroos and Ilkay Gündogan have 378 caps between them and a depth of understanding honed over more than a decade.</p> <p>“I can vouch for our players who already have a three in front [of their age],” Neuer joked on Monday. He is 38 and, like Kroos, is back on the scene after an extended absence. Germany’s veterans are not unscarred by recent failures but most of them know how it feels to have the world at their feet.</p> <p>“They have all experienced solutions for different situations, especially when you talk about pressure and expectations, on and off the pitch,” Nagelsmann said.</p>    <p>Watching Kroos run the show against Scotland it was hard not to feel helpless that such an extraordinary talent will retire this&nbsp;summer while seemingly at the top of his game. Perhaps Kroos, whose gifts can fly beneath the radar amid Real Madrid’s razzmatazz, will receive the tributes he deserves when this competition has finished. “He’s still one of the top three players in the world at finding teammates between the lines, creating chances and setting up goals,” Nagelsmann said. “And I think he’ll do that tomorrow as well.”</p> <p>If Hungary begin as they did in an underwhelming <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/jun/15/hungary-switzerland-euro-2024-match-report\">defeat by Switzerland</a>, when they were alarmingly open in the first half, Kroos and Gündogan may pick them apart. Nagelsmann was keen to stress that Marco Rossi’s team had improved significantly after the interval, talking up their threat from crosses and set pieces. He will also be aware that Hungary have established some kind of hold over the host nation of late. They won a Nations League match in Leipzig before Qatar 2022 and forced a 2-2 draw in a gloriously chaotic group‑stage match at Euro 2020.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2024/05/mens-euros-players/embed/germany/1/player.html\" data-alt=\"Manuel Neuer profile\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2024/05/mens-euros-players/embed/germany/1/player.html\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>But Germany exude certainty now. The captain Gündogan, who is serious about his role as on‑pitch mentor to Wirtz and Musiala, was illuminating in spelling out the difference Nagelsmann has made. “It helped us a lot that the coach defined a clear role,” he said. “That helped us a lot, especially after the negative experiences of the last tournaments. There is clarity among the team, also because the coach exudes security.”</p> <p>Discipline away from the pitch will also be in focus before a match that has been deemed a high security risk. Up to 20,000 Hungary fans are expected to attend and the police presence will extend to more than 2,500 officers. A range of measures will be implemented to keep large groups of opposing supporters separate.</p> <p>Hungary hope a continuation of their form against the Germans will be the headline. A defeat would leave them on the brink of elimination and Rossi struck a pragmatic note. “In my opinion Germany are the toughest team to play against right now,” he said “We will do our very best. We know the German team is better than us. We can say this and nobody needs to take offence – it can motivate us. We can give it our best shot. Hopefully we can grasp a point and that will give us a chance to qualify.”</p> <p>Nagelsmann, who allowed his players free time with their families after the Scotland game, hopes to keep the good feeling going. “I hope I prepared them well,” he said.</p> <p>The benefits of those age-based practice games are there to be reaped once more.</p>',\n",

I don’t ask our guys to win, to score goals. I just ask them to give their maximum.”</p> <p>Gündogan had a different view of the opener. “I was quite surprised that the Hungarian player and his teammates were angry about it,” he said. “I don’t know what it looked like on TV but I played in the Premier League for seven years and if you gave that in the Premier League as a foul I think everyone would have been laughing on the floor.”</p> <p>Julian Nagelsmann, whose team have reached the knockout stage with a game to spare, urged Germany to finish the job by topping Group A. “We want to be first in our group and then we will see,” he said. “For today I’m happy with the result.

       "   'body': '<p>Which of Germany’s old stagers will be next to steal the scene? Toni Kroos had teased Scotland to pieces on the opening day but this time the floor was left to his captain, who delivered a resounding statement. Four months from now Ilkay Gündogan will turn 34 but this was another of those evenings where, as with his imminently retiring colleague, the idea that the show will one day end feels simply unfair.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/jun/19/hungarys-marco-rossi-accuses-referee-of-double-standard-after-germany-loss\">Hungary’s Marco Rossi accuses referee of ‘double standard’ after Germany loss</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Gündogan intervened decisively midway through each half, creating the opener for Jamal Musiala and sweeping in a second goal that finally deflated a largely impressive Hungary. Had Marco Rossi’s players converted one presentable chance among several, notably through Barnabas Varga on the hour, they would have quietened a buoyant crowd. Instead they were the latest to find that the hosts have begun this summer with the dead-eyed edge of old. Germany were clinical and their momentum is gathering.</p> <p>If the veterans are trading star billing, Musiala is a dazzling constant. “The way he’s going right now, he can be one of the best,” Gündogan said afterwards and it was justified praise. He turned in another irrepressible performance and what a special moment it was when, in his home city, he met the captain’s pass and hammered high into the net. Musiala tormented Hungary out wide but his acuity in occupying pockets of space more centrally was fundamental to the moments that won this game.</p> <p>Exhibit A came in the 22nd minute of a game Germany had started slowly, finding that Hungary were as good as their word in promising a more aggressive display than in a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/jun/15/hungary-switzerland-euro-2024-match-report\">poor defeat against Switzerland</a>. Some of the hosts’ connections around the box had started to show promise, and Peter Gulascsi had saved from Kai Havertz after ineffectual defending from Willi Orban, but it took Musiala’s initiative to calm their early jitters.</p>    <p>Musiala had collected the ball in a tight space on the edge of the box, with four opponents looking to minimise his options, and slipped it through to an on-rushing Gündogan. There was a sizeable element of fortune after that, the pass bouncing off his thigh as he sought to tame it and seemingly allowing Orban to take control.</p> <p>The centre-back, no more convincing than he had been earlier on, stumbled as he tried to shepherd the ball towards the byline. The complaint was that Gündogan had shoved him, but Orban had seemed to lean into his opponent and surely should have been stronger. Several of Hungary’s players certainly erred in stopping with hands held aloft while the midfielder took control of matters and, from the left side of the six‑yard box, teed up an alert Musiala for a second thudding finish in as many games.</p> <p>Hungary had come close after only 16 seconds, Manuel Neuer diving at the feet of Roland Sallai, and gave the 38-year-old more to do. They did not appear perturbed at going behind and were denied soon afterwards when Neuer brilliantly repelled a Dominik Szoboszlai free-kick and blocked the rebound from Varga. If the excellence of golden oldies is to be a theme, Neuer was another who warmed to it.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/jun/19/scotland-switzerland-euro-2024-group-a-match-report\">Scotland keep knockout hopes alive after battling draw with Switzerland</a> </p> </aside>  <p>By the three-quarter mark Germany had not put Hungary, who had recorded a win and two draws in their previous three meetings, out of view. Then Kroos sped up a prolonged passing move with a first-time clip to Musiala, imbued with instructions to maintain that raised tempo. Eyes in the back of his head, Musiala found the left‑back Maximilian Mittelstädt in space and the resulting cutback was swept in by Gündogan.</p> <p>He barely put a foot wrong throughout and Julian Nagelsmann pointed out that, off the ball, he had kept Germany on the straight and narrow when they were listing. “He worked amazingly,” Nagelsmann said. “He tried to steer the match, he used some of the stoppages and tried to double check things with me. I have big trust in him because I know what is within him.”</p> <p>Perhaps the post-match enthusiasm would have been more restrained if Varga, unmarked from a perfect Sallai cross, had equalised rather than looping his header over. There was little influence Gundogan could exert on that sequence. Sallai had a goal correctly disallowed before the interval and, towards the end, a late goalline clearance from Joshua Kimmich ensured the bank of almost 20,000 fans behind Neuer’s goal were left with nothing bar an improved showing to savour. Hungary, fancied as potential dark horses, are on the brink of elimination.</p> <p>For Germany the latter stages were celebratory and Nagelsmann could play to the gallery by enhancing the local flavour. Mittelstadt, who plays here for VfB Stuttgart, was joined on the pitch by clubmates Chris Fuhrich and the Brighton loanee Deniz Undav; the crowd loved those little touches, just as they had adored those of Gundogan and his cohort.</p>',\n",

      "{'byline': 'Jonathan Liew in Berlin', 'body': '<p>If only the Germans had a word for “zeitgeist”. There’s a football tournament starting here on Friday, not that you would necessarily know it. Indeed, from a cursory trawl of Thursday’s media what was most striking of all was the absence of Euros-buzz, the suspicion that there are bigger priorities out there. “CANCER,” screamed the front page of <em>Bild</em>, just in case you were thinking of getting too excited. Chancellor Olaf Scholz is missing the opening game to attend the G7 in Italy. The sports bulletins were dominated by the sudden resignation of the Borussia Dortmund coach, Edin Terzic. On the Kicker website, the first Euro 2024 news appeared some way below a story about RB Leipzig’s summer transfer business.</p> <p>None of which should necessarily be mistaken for pure apathy. Rather, there is a more complex melange of emotions at work here. Euro 2024 is still very much present, as long as you know where to look: the big town squares where overseas fans have begun to congregate, the television ad breaks where Joshua Kimmich is shaving his chin baby-smooth with a next-generation razor. Tickets for Germany’s open training session in Jena sold out in 10 minutes.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/jun/13/we-have-everything-nagelsmann-talks-up-germany-before-scotland-opener\">‘We have everything’: Nagelsmann talks up Germany before Scotland opener</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But, among the great unconverted, there remains a certain tactical restraint. This is a public burned by past failures, who pledge primary loyalty to their club teams, who above all are wary of overcommiting too early. When even the great Toni Kroos lists France, Portugal and England as his three favourites, with the host nation in the chase group just behind, the attempt at expectation management is clear enough. Germany is not all-in on this team yet. By 11pm on Friday night, that could very well have changed.</p> <p>Through history, Germany’s campaigns have often thrived or foundered on their opening game. Each of their seven previous tournament victories began with a win; indeed, Germany have never failed to reach the quarter-finals after winning their first game. Even now, Philipp Lahm is best remembered as the man whose curling shot against Costa Rica started the euphoria machine that was the 2006 World Cup.</p> <p>By contrast, each of Germany’s past three tournaments has begun with a momentum-crushing defeat: to Mexico in 2018, France in 2021 and Japan in 2022. Lose to Scotland in Munich on Friday, and all of a sudden Sommermärchen 2.0 will take on a vividly different shade. “The first match is very, very&nbsp;important,” Kroos said earlier this week. “The last few tournaments have shown that in a negative way.”</p>    <p>One of the ironies of Germany’s slump at international level over recent years is that it has coincided with a rich vein of form for German clubs in Europe. Bayern won the Champions League in 2020; Eintracht Frankfurt the Europa League in 2022; Borussia Dortmund made this year’s Champions League final; Bayer Leverkusen were the best team in the world for large parts of this season, surrendering their unbeaten record only in their penultimate game, the Europa League final against Atalanta.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the likes of Kroos, Antonio Rüdiger and Ilkay Gündogan have won practically everything there is to win at club level. Point being: this is a squad that knows how to rise to the big occasion. The issue, of late, has been doing so in tandem.</p> <p>But over the short invigorating months under Julian Nagelsmann, the pieces have slowly come together. Rüdiger and Jonathan Tah have forged a strong partnership at the heart of defence, solving one of Germany’s longstanding issues at a stroke. “It just works,” Rüdiger said recently. Kimmich at right-back will have the job of dealing with the overlapping Andrew Robertson. On the opposite flank Maximilian Mittelstädt, who has had a breakout&nbsp;season with Stuttgart, provides an underrated attacking threat of his&nbsp;own.</p> <p>Gündogan and Kroos, with Robert Andrich behind them, form a midfield to envy any in the tournament. The return of the all-conquering Kroos offers this team not just an unerring passing game and a champion mentality, but a certain sense of mission: an opportunity to elevate their teammate into the pantheon occupied by generational greats like&nbsp;Xavi, Andrés Iniesta and Zinedine Zidane who won everything there was to win, who essentially completed football. Then you have the front three, with&nbsp;Florian Wirtz and Jamal Musiala providing the creativity and Kai Havertz the cutting edge up front. Niclas Füllkrug, Leroy Sané and Thomas Müller are more likely to make an impact from the bench but could feature more extensively&nbsp;later.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/jun/13/germany-and-nagelsmann-still-trying-to-solve-their-ilkay-gundogan-puzzle\">Germany and Nagelsmann still trying to solve their Ilkay Gündogan puzzle</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This is, by any measure, a team capable of challenging. In fact, pretty much the only genuine selection dilemma for Nagelsmann is in what has traditionally been the strongest position of all. “We don’t need a discussion about our goalkeeper,” the sporting director, Rudi Völler, said this week. Yep, good luck with that. In reality the mistake by Manuel Neuer in the recent friendly against Greece – the latest in a string of errors by the 38-year-old – has reopened the debate over the No&nbsp;1 shirt. In any other era Marc-André ter Stegen would probably have 120 caps rather than the 40 he has managed to scrape together in Neuer’s shadow. Neuer will start the tournament, but is by no means guaranteed to finish it.</p> <p>All of which has unfolded against the backdrop of a certain cautious optimism, with the emphasis on caution. This is perhaps the first tournament for a generation where Germans are bearish rather than bullish on their chances: analogous in many ways to England in 2018, driven to cynicism by one too many tournament fiascos.</p> <p>The fervour and focus of a home crowd can drive teams to places they never thought they could go, make them feel irresistible, make opponents feel peripheral. In a tournament stacked with contenders, Germany will need&nbsp;that&nbsp;surge of sentiment to push them&nbsp;over the line.

Like Karani, who was born in Germany, most Turkish Germans trace their ancestry to the <em>Gastarbeiter</em> (guest worker) movement of the 1960s and 70s.</p> <p>As a result, after the host nation Germany, no other European Championship participant will receive as much support as Turkey. The elation with which the Turkish national team was greeted last week during its public training session at its base in Barsinghausen, Lower Saxony, gave something of a foretaste of the reception the team is likely to receive in Dortmund on Tuesday evening, followed four days later there against Portugal and on 26 June against the Czech Republic in Hamburg.</p> <p>Some who failed to get tickets clambered up into the tree tops hoping for a glance into the training ground. They cheered Vincenzo Montella’s team with flags, homemade placards and cries of “Türkiye, Türkiye”. Many were already in national team kit or wore the shirts of their favourite Istanbul clubs. They hovered on the sidelines hoping for autographs or selfies with the stars, such as Real Madrid’s Arda Guler, Borussia Dortmund’s Salih Ozcan and the captain, Hakan Calhanoglu.</p>    <p>“We really feel at home when we’re in Germany,” the attacking midfielder, Yusuf Yazici, told journalists on the sidelines. “It’s like having your nation accompany you, such was the enthusiasm, and we’re all very happy to see them wherever we go.”</p> <p>Ozgur Ozvatan, a political scientist and sociologist at the Berlin Institute for Empirical Research on Integration and Migration says a <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/match/_/gameId/688956/turkey-germany\">friendly between Turkey and Germany</a> last November showed just how much potential there is for the Turkish fan scene to be politicised, driven in no small part by the nationalist momentum behind Turkey’s president Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who was visiting Germany at the time. But he says, around this championship, there is much to suggest that pure unalloyed emotion is the factor motivating most fans.</p> <p>“If you look at the sense of delight, it seems to be something that is less political and rather more to do with joy and euphoria that the Turkish national team is in Germany, and that those who support Turkey in Germany have the feeling that they are the hosts for this national team,” he said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/jun/14/euro-2024-team-guides-part-24-turkey\">Euro 2024 team guides part 24: Turkey</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Tugsal Mogul, theatre director, anaesthetist and football fan, who has supported Borussia Mönchengladbach all his life, has brought to the stage his mixed feelings about the internal strife he has often felt when urged to support either Turkey or Germany. <em><a href=\"https://staatstheater-hannover.de/de_DE/programm/unsere-elf.1343726\">Unsere Elf</a></em> (Our Eleven – A Somewhat Alternative National Anthem), which is playing at Hanover’s Staatstheater as part of the cultural programme around the Euros, explores racism, integration, migration and right-wing extremism, issues that have often been inextricably tied up with the game.</p> <p>As a child of Turkish migrants who was born in Germany’s industrial heartland of North Rhein Westphalia, Mogul says he often felt at a distance from Germany’s national team. “For years I wanted Germany to lose,” he said. “I was born here, my mother tongue is German, but I just could not identify with this team for a very long time.”</p> <p>The so-called <em>Sommermärchen</em> (summer fairytale) of 2006, when Germany hosted the World Cup and for a few short weeks, all seemed well with the world, was an experience he shared, but only to a certain extent. “It was the best of summers. I very much warmed to the German team. It was more diverse, more different than it had ever been. Sports-wise also on another level,” Mogul says.</p> <p>But it was also the height of what were initially dismissed as the “Kebab murders”, a string of racist killings by a neo-Nazi terrorist group, the NSU, the main targets of which were ethnic Turks, but who were long under suspicion by authorities of having carried out the attacks among themselves. “This image of the <em>Sommermärchen</em>, of a perfect world, a land without racism – it wasn’t quite correct. I remember seeing all the Germany flags at the windows, and feeling both appalled and happy,” he said.</p> <p>By 2014, captivated by none other than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/nov/15/mesut-ozil-turkish-german-football\">Mesut Özil</a>, “his legs, his style of play,” Mogul brought his first Germany shirt. “In Turkey,” he says with a chuckle. That dream also famously <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/mar/24/an-ode-to-mesut-ozil-the-frictionless-footballer-not-designed-for-the-age-of-rage\">turned sour</a>. Özil, widely considered one of Germany’s best players, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jul/22/mesut-ozil-retires-german-national-team-discrimination\">resigned from the national team</a> in 2018 citing discrimination, stating: “I am German when we win, but I am an immigrant when we lose”. In some ways the affair still overshadows the national team and to this day calls into question its claim to be a motor for integration.</p>    <p>Ozvatan, the political scientist, himself a former professional footballer, said that while he believed Özil was responsible for his own views, the German football federation (DFB) did not do itself proud in the way it dealt with his claim. He also talked about a poll from the recent <a href=\"https://presse.wdr.de/plounge/wdr/programm/2024/06/20240602_einigkeit_recht_vielfalt.html\">documentary by Philipp Awounou</a>, in which 21% of respondents said they agreed with the statement: “I would prefer it if more white players played in the German national team again”.</p> <p>“The reaction of the national team coach [Julian Nagelsmann] was to say: it was a shit poll, instead of saying: ‘This is a problem in Germany and we need to deal with it,’” Ozvatan says. “But these things cannot just be brushed under the carpet”.</p> <p>Mogul said despite some strife, there is much to be proud of in both Turkey and Germany’s teams, including Ilkay Gundogan, the grandson of a Turkish <em>gastarbeiter</em>, captaining the German team. For the opening game the TV camera seemed to linger on him a little longer than on anyone else, perhaps to see if he knew the words of the national anthem. (He did.)</p> <p>On the Kurfürstendamm boulevard, following Germany’s 5-1 win against Scotland on Friday night, a group of young German-Turks stood on the side of the road cheering as a constant stream of cars bearing German flags drove by, honking their horns in celebration. “We’re really happy that Germany won,” Adem, 18, said. “And I would also like to feel the same warmth from the Germans towards Turkey if and when we win.”</p>', 'wordcount': '1152'}\n",

Of course you are. It’s been 13 long summer days since Real Madrid won the Champions League final, but the wait is almost over. We’re about to break the seal on a 30-day football buffet, where the games and goals will just keep piling up. You tell yourself that you <em>might</em> skip Poland v Austria next Friday, but you know you won’t.</p> <p>We’re all in, and if the trophy belongs to the players and the tournament belongs to the fans who will criss-cross between Germany’s great football cathedrals, then maybe this moment belongs to us, the armchair fans. The simple joy of a big summer tournament feels like an increasingly rare treat, so let’s savour the moment.</p> <p>Tonight’s opener, pencilled in the diary ever since the draw in early December, feels like a perfect first act. It pits the hosts, among the favourites but still not quite finding that elusive extra gear, against perennial underdogs in Scotland. Steve Clarke’s side appear to have slipped backwards since their exceptional qualifying campaign, drifting from dark horses to outsiders in a tricky Group A.</p> <p>That said, if you have to play Germany in Germany, this is the time to do it – when rustiness and first-night nerves could really play a part. All the pressure is on the hosts tonight, and the longer Scotland can keep them at bay, the greater the tension inside the, er, Munich Football Arena. There lies the path to a shock victory – and if you can’t dream now, when can you?</p> <p>Kick-off is at 9pm local time, 8pm BST and we’ll have all the buildup, team news and coverage of the opening ceremony. <em>Auf geht’s!</em></p> </div>   </div>', 'wordcount': '4225'}\n",
      "{'byline': 'Barry Glendenning', 'body': '<h2><strong>WE WON’T EVEN MENTION THAT TV CLIP</strong></h2> <p>Write off the Germans. They say you should never do it, but we just have because today Euro 2024 Daily is channeling its inner William Wallace and is – for one day only – happy to do so. In the run-up to Friday’s eagerly awaited curtain-raiser between the hosts and Steve Clarke’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/jun/14/fear-of-missing-out-scotland-fans-arrive-munich\">travelling Tartan Army</a>, you find us buzzing on Buckie and basking in the sense of enormous wellbeing generated by the sight and screeching sounds of that bevvied-up pipe and drum band who went viral courtesy of their march on Munich’s Marienplatz from Odeonsplatz on Thursday. OK, so they may not have been as viewed as often as that tired and emotional lone bagpiper who went bahoochie-over-brogues off the edge of a München restaurant booth without so much as missing a note as he crashed down, but if the team can maintain similar composure in the face of extreme adversity, who’s to say they won’t get a result?</p> <p>The omens are good. Or bad, depending on your point of view. In the 11 major tournaments they have – and Euro 2024 Daily uses this term advisedly – <em>contested</em>, Scotland have won just three times. One of those came against the footballing stronghold of New Zealand, while the others were at the expense of Yugoslavia and Zaire, two nations of whom our younger reader may genuinely never have heard. Scotland have also failed to win any of their opening games in any of their last six tournaments, while the most recent Scottish international to score a goal at a major competition on foreign soil <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/jun/12/craig-burley-warns-scotland-before-euro-2024-opener\">is Craig Burley</a>, who is aged 52. What’s more, in five competitive matches against Germany, Scotland have never won once, so while a pessimist might point out that both history and the odds <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/jun/13/we-have-everything-nagelsmann-talks-up-germany-before-scotland-opener\">are stacked against them</a>, someone who views their glass of Irn-Bru as being more half-full would argue that their time has finally come.</p> <p>In what is ostensibly a free hit for Clarke’s side before far easier – but still difficult – assignments to come, any kind of positive result would provide a rock-solid platform from which Scotland could subsequently catapult themselves into the knockout stages of a major tournament <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/jun/13/scotland-get-serious-as-steve-clarkes-men-eye-their-chance-to-make-history\">for the first time in their history</a>. “We want to make history,” <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/jun/13/prospect-of-becoming-legends-drives-us-says-scotlands-andy-robertson\">roared Andy Robertson</a>, who will lead his side into battle. “We have so many incentives here, but becoming a legendary squad is the biggest. That’s what has to drive us forward. The thought of being the first Scotland team to make a knockout round is our driving force. If we manage that? You just never know.”</p> <p>Well, you have a pretty good idea, but now is not the time to dwell on negatives, not least when everybody’s favourite fitba pundit, Ally McCoist, is brimful of optimism after getting his monster riffola on in the mosh pit of AC/DC’s gig at Munich’s Olympiastadion on Tuesday night. “The Germany game is a great game for us because it’s the opening game,” he tooted on TalkSport. “Germany have obviously had a bit of form and 100% they’ll be deservedly favourites – but it’s a good game for us to open with.” Top of the bill alongside Germany for Friday’s showdown at the Allianz Arena [Munich Football Arena, actually – Uefa Lawyers]<em>,</em> a win for Scotland would give them the momentum of a Rock N Roll Train and guarantee that their boisterous and good-humoured travelling fans shake the Bavarian capital all night long.</p> <h2><strong>LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE</strong></h2> <p>Join Niall McVeigh from 6pm for hot coverage of the Euro 2024 opening ceremony, followed by minute-by-minute updates from Germany 0-0 Scotland.</p> <h2><strong>QUOTE OF THE DAY</strong></h2> <p>“It started as a joke – hang a ball sprayed with text in a tree.

The trouble with these things is that the choices are too limited: rather than just two bowls of food or whatever, there should be 24, weighted according to the probability of success. So France, at betting odds of 4-1, get a quarter-size bowl, while Albania at 500-1 get, er, one 500th of a bowl. Unfortunately that will make some bowls rather too small to see; we’ll need something with good eyesight – say, an osprey, or a bald eagle?

      "{'byline': 'Nick Ames in Stuttgart', 'body': '<p>Sometimes, in an effort to mix things up towards the end of Germany’s training sessions, Julian Nagelsmann cooks up a clash of generations. The more youthful half of his unit contest a match against their seniors and it is, in the manager’s words, “always a hard fight”. Neither team consistently holds sway over the other and any battle lines are purely cosmetic. “To have a good mix is really positive,” he said. “The mood in our camp is excellent and the connection between the younger and older players is really good.”</p> <p>Germany’s blend clicked <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/jun/15/kai-havertz-more-to-come-euro-2024-germany-scotland\">to delightful effect against Scotland</a>. Their youngest players, the 21-year-olds Jamal Musiala and Florian Wirtz, scored fine goals and&nbsp;were given their platform by&nbsp;an experienced base like no other. Given their speed and verve it is a surprise to note that Germany have the highest average age at Euro&nbsp;2024; it is even more of an eye-opener that, should they lift the trophy in Berlin next month, they will be the oldest European champions in the tournament’s&nbsp;history.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/jun/18/turkey-georgia-euro-2024-group-f-match-report\">Arda Guler brings the thunder as Turkey survive storm to beat Georgia</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“We have to find some solutions for the future,” Nagelsmann said, clearly aware that the present finely balanced setup will probably not even survive into the next World Cup. “But for the tournament we’re in now, it’s the perfect mix and we can be very successful.”</p> <p>A win against Hungary in Stuttgart, guaranteeing a place in the last 16 with a game to spare, would heighten that impression. Nagelsmann will name the same side that thrashed Scotland: why tinker when, bar a freakish own goal from Antonio Rüdiger, their performance had been virtually perfect? The spine will comprise four thirtysomethings: Rüdiger, Manuel Neuer, Toni Kroos and Ilkay Gündogan have 378 caps between them and a depth of understanding honed over more than a decade.</p> <p>“I can vouch for our players who already have a three in front [of their age],” Neuer joked on Monday. He is 38 and, like Kroos, is back on the scene after an extended absence. Germany’s veterans are not unscarred by recent failures but most of them know how it feels to have the world at their feet.</p> <p>“They have all experienced solutions for different situations, especially when you talk about pressure and expectations, on and off the pitch,” Nagelsmann said.</p>    <p>Watching Kroos run the show against Scotland it was hard not to feel helpless that such an extraordinary talent will retire this&nbsp;summer while seemingly at the top of his game. Perhaps Kroos, whose gifts can fly beneath the radar amid Real Madrid’s razzmatazz, will receive the tributes he deserves when this competition has finished. “He’s still one of the top three players in the world at finding teammates between the lines, creating chances and setting up goals,” Nagelsmann said. “And I think he’ll do that tomorrow as well.”</p> <p>If Hungary begin as they did in an underwhelming <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/jun/15/hungary-switzerland-euro-2024-match-report\">defeat by Switzerland</a>, when they were alarmingly open in the first half, Kroos and Gündogan may pick them apart. Nagelsmann was keen to stress that Marco Rossi’s team had improved significantly after the interval, talking up their threat from crosses and set pieces. He will also be aware that Hungary have established some kind of hold over the host nation of late. They won a Nations League match in Leipzig before Qatar 2022 and forced a 2-2 draw in a gloriously chaotic group‑stage match at Euro 2020.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2024/05/mens-euros-players/embed/germany/1/player.html\" data-alt=\"Manuel Neuer profile\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2024/05/mens-euros-players/embed/germany/1/player.html\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>But Germany exude certainty now. The captain Gündogan, who is serious about his role as on‑pitch mentor to Wirtz and Musiala, was illuminating in spelling out the difference Nagelsmann has made. “It helped us a lot that the coach defined a clear role,” he said. “That helped us a lot, especially after the negative experiences of the last tournaments. There is clarity among the team, also because the coach exudes security.”</p> <p>Discipline away from the pitch will also be in focus before a match that has been deemed a high security risk. Up to 20,000 Hungary fans are expected to attend and the police presence will extend to more than 2,500 officers. A range of measures will be implemented to keep large groups of opposing supporters separate.</p> <p>Hungary hope a continuation of their form against the Germans will be the headline. A defeat would leave them on the brink of elimination and Rossi struck a pragmatic note. “In my opinion Germany are the toughest team to play against right now,” he said “We will do our very best. We know the German team is better than us. We can say this and nobody needs to take offence – it can motivate us. We can give it our best shot. Hopefully we can grasp a point and that will give us a chance to qualify.”</p> <p>Nagelsmann, who allowed his players free time with their families after the Scotland game, hopes to keep the good feeling going. “I hope I prepared them well,” he said.</p> <p>The benefits of those age-based practice games are there to be reaped once more.</p>', 'wordcount': '824'}\n",

In truth contact had been light and, on balance, the decision seemed correct. But it set Hungary on the way to a defeat that leaves their participation beyond the group stage at Euro 2024 in grave doubt and Rossi pondered whether bigger-name sides might have been treated differently.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/jun/19/germany-hungary-euro-2024-group-a-match-report\">Musiala and Gündogan shine as Germany ease to win against Hungary</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“What the referee did tonight, it’s a double standard,” said Rossi, citing an incident in the second half when the Germany midfielder Robert Andrich tumbled in his own box and was given a foul. “From my perspective Germany would have won anyway, they’re stronger than us, but the referee was the worst on the pitch.</p> <p>“Germany didn’t need help from the referee, especially against a team like Hungary.

I don’t ask our guys to win, to score goals. I just ask them to give their maximum.”</p> <p>Gündogan had a different view of the opener. “I was quite surprised that the Hungarian player and his teammates were angry about it,” he said. “I don’t know what it looked like on TV but I played in the Premier League for seven years and if you gave that in the Premier League as a foul I think everyone would have been laughing on the floor.”</p> <p>Julian Nagelsmann, whose team have reached the knockout stage with a game to spare, urged Germany to finish the job by topping Group A. “We want to be first in our group and then we will see,” he said. “For today I’m happy with the result.

      "{'byline': 'Nick Ames at the Stuttgart Arena', 'body': '<p>Which of Germany’s old stagers will be next to steal the scene? Toni Kroos had teased Scotland to pieces on the opening day but this time the floor was left to his captain, who delivered a resounding statement. Four months from now Ilkay Gündogan will turn 34 but this was another of those evenings where, as with his imminently retiring colleague, the idea that the show will one day end feels simply unfair.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/jun/19/hungarys-marco-rossi-accuses-referee-of-double-standard-after-germany-loss\">Hungary’s Marco Rossi accuses referee of ‘double standard’ after Germany loss</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Gündogan intervened decisively midway through each half, creating the opener for Jamal Musiala and sweeping in a second goal that finally deflated a largely impressive Hungary. Had Marco Rossi’s players converted one presentable chance among several, notably through Barnabas Varga on the hour, they would have quietened a buoyant crowd. Instead they were the latest to find that the hosts have begun this summer with the dead-eyed edge of old. Germany were clinical and their momentum is gathering.</p> <p>If the veterans are trading star billing, Musiala is a dazzling constant. “The way he’s going right now, he can be one of the best,” Gündogan said afterwards and it was justified praise. He turned in another irrepressible performance and what a special moment it was when, in his home city, he met the captain’s pass and hammered high into the net. Musiala tormented Hungary out wide but his acuity in occupying pockets of space more centrally was fundamental to the moments that won this game.</p> <p>Exhibit A came in the 22nd minute of a game Germany had started slowly, finding that Hungary were as good as their word in promising a more aggressive display than in a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/jun/15/hungary-switzerland-euro-2024-match-report\">poor defeat against Switzerland</a>. Some of the hosts’ connections around the box had started to show promise, and Peter Gulascsi had saved from Kai Havertz after ineffectual defending from Willi Orban, but it took Musiala’s initiative to calm their early jitters.</p>    <p>Musiala had collected the ball in a tight space on the edge of the box, with four opponents looking to minimise his options, and slipped it through to an on-rushing Gündogan. There was a sizeable element of fortune after that, the pass bouncing off his thigh as he sought to tame it and seemingly allowing Orban to take control.</p> <p>The centre-back, no more convincing than he had been earlier on, stumbled as he tried to shepherd the ball towards the byline. The complaint was that Gündogan had shoved him, but Orban had seemed to lean into his opponent and surely should have been stronger. Several of Hungary’s players certainly erred in stopping with hands held aloft while the midfielder took control of matters and, from the left side of the six‑yard box, teed up an alert Musiala for a second thudding finish in as many games.</p> <p>Hungary had come close after only 16 seconds, Manuel Neuer diving at the feet of Roland Sallai, and gave the 38-year-old more to do. They did not appear perturbed at going behind and were denied soon afterwards when Neuer brilliantly repelled a Dominik Szoboszlai free-kick and blocked the rebound from Varga. If the excellence of golden oldies is to be a theme, Neuer was another who warmed to it.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/jun/19/scotland-switzerland-euro-2024-group-a-match-report\">Scotland keep knockout hopes alive after battling draw with Switzerland</a> </p> </aside>  <p>By the three-quarter mark Germany had not put Hungary, who had recorded a win and two draws in their previous three meetings, out of view. Then Kroos sped up a prolonged passing move with a first-time clip to Musiala, imbued with instructions to maintain that raised tempo. Eyes in the back of his head, Musiala found the left‑back Maximilian Mittelstädt in space and the resulting cutback was swept in by Gündogan.</p> <p>He barely put a foot wrong throughout and Julian Nagelsmann pointed out that, off the ball, he had kept Germany on the straight and narrow when they were listing. “He worked amazingly,” Nagelsmann said. “He tried to steer the match, he used some of the stoppages and tried to double check things with me. I have big trust in him because I know what is within him.”</p> <p>Perhaps the post-match enthusiasm would have been more restrained if Varga, unmarked from a perfect Sallai cross, had equalised rather than looping his header over. There was little influence Gundogan could exert on that sequence. Sallai had a goal correctly disallowed before the interval and, towards the end, a late goalline clearance from Joshua Kimmich ensured the bank of almost 20,000 fans behind Neuer’s goal were left with nothing bar an improved showing to savour. Hungary, fancied as potential dark horses, are on the brink of elimination.</p> <p>For Germany the latter stages were celebratory and Nagelsmann could play to the gallery by enhancing the local flavour. Mittelstadt, who plays here for VfB Stuttgart, was joined on the pitch by clubmates Chris Fuhrich and the Brighton loanee Deniz Undav; the crowd loved those little touches, just as they had adored those of Gundogan and his cohort.</p>', 'wordcount': '811'}\n",

      "<p>If only the Germans had a word for “zeitgeist”. There’s a football tournament starting here on Friday, not that you would necessarily know it. Indeed, from a cursory trawl of Thursday’s media what was most striking of all was the absence of Euros-buzz, the suspicion that there are bigger priorities out there. “CANCER,” screamed the front page of <em>Bild</em>, just in case you were thinking of getting too excited. Chancellor Olaf Scholz is missing the opening game to attend the G7 in Italy. The sports bulletins were dominated by the sudden resignation of the Borussia Dortmund coach, Edin Terzic. On the Kicker website, the first Euro 2024 news appeared some way below a story about RB Leipzig’s summer transfer business.</p> <p>None of which should necessarily be mistaken for pure apathy. Rather, there is a more complex melange of emotions at work here. Euro 2024 is still very much present, as long as you know where to look: the big town squares where overseas fans have begun to congregate, the television ad breaks where Joshua Kimmich is shaving his chin baby-smooth with a next-generation razor. Tickets for Germany’s open training session in Jena sold out in 10 minutes.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/jun/13/we-have-everything-nagelsmann-talks-up-germany-before-scotland-opener\">‘We have everything’: Nagelsmann talks up Germany before Scotland opener</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But, among the great unconverted, there remains a certain tactical restraint. This is a public burned by past failures, who pledge primary loyalty to their club teams, who above all are wary of overcommiting too early. When even the great Toni Kroos lists France, Portugal and England as his three favourites, with the host nation in the chase group just behind, the attempt at expectation management is clear enough. Germany is not all-in on this team yet. By 11pm on Friday night, that could very well have changed.</p> <p>Through history, Germany’s campaigns have often thrived or foundered on their opening game. Each of their seven previous tournament victories began with a win; indeed, Germany have never failed to reach the quarter-finals after winning their first game. Even now, Philipp Lahm is best remembered as the man whose curling shot against Costa Rica started the euphoria machine that was the 2006 World Cup.</p> <p>By contrast, each of Germany’s past three tournaments has begun with a momentum-crushing defeat: to Mexico in 2018, France in 2021 and Japan in 2022. Lose to Scotland in Munich on Friday, and all of a sudden Sommermärchen 2.0 will take on a vividly different shade. “The first match is very, very&nbsp;important,” Kroos said earlier this week. “The last few tournaments have shown that in a negative way.”</p>    <p>One of the ironies of Germany’s slump at international level over recent years is that it has coincided with a rich vein of form for German clubs in Europe. Bayern won the Champions League in 2020; Eintracht Frankfurt the Europa League in 2022; Borussia Dortmund made this year’s Champions League final; Bayer Leverkusen were the best team in the world for large parts of this season, surrendering their unbeaten record only in their penultimate game, the Europa League final against Atalanta.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the likes of Kroos, Antonio Rüdiger and Ilkay Gündogan have won practically everything there is to win at club level. Point being: this is a squad that knows how to rise to the big occasion. The issue, of late, has been doing so in tandem.</p> <p>But over the short invigorating months under Julian Nagelsmann, the pieces have slowly come together. Rüdiger and Jonathan Tah have forged a strong partnership at the heart of defence, solving one of Germany’s longstanding issues at a stroke. “It just works,” Rüdiger said recently. Kimmich at right-back will have the job of dealing with the overlapping Andrew Robertson. On the opposite flank Maximilian Mittelstädt, who has had a breakout&nbsp;season with Stuttgart, provides an underrated attacking threat of his&nbsp;own.</p> <p>Gündogan and Kroos, with Robert Andrich behind them, form a midfield to envy any in the tournament. The return of the all-conquering Kroos offers this team not just an unerring passing game and a champion mentality, but a certain sense of mission: an opportunity to elevate their teammate into the pantheon occupied by generational greats like&nbsp;Xavi, Andrés Iniesta and Zinedine Zidane who won everything there was to win, who essentially completed football. Then you have the front three, with&nbsp;Florian Wirtz and Jamal Musiala providing the creativity and Kai Havertz the cutting edge up front. Niclas Füllkrug, Leroy Sané and Thomas Müller are more likely to make an impact from the bench but could feature more extensively&nbsp;later.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/jun/13/germany-and-nagelsmann-still-trying-to-solve-their-ilkay-gundogan-puzzle\">Germany and Nagelsmann still trying to solve their Ilkay Gündogan puzzle</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This is, by any measure, a team capable of challenging. In fact, pretty much the only genuine selection dilemma for Nagelsmann is in what has traditionally been the strongest position of all. “We don’t need a discussion about our goalkeeper,” the sporting director, Rudi Völler, said this week. Yep, good luck with that. In reality the mistake by Manuel Neuer in the recent friendly against Greece – the latest in a string of errors by the 38-year-old – has reopened the debate over the No&nbsp;1 shirt. In any other era Marc-André ter Stegen would probably have 120 caps rather than the 40 he has managed to scrape together in Neuer’s shadow. Neuer will start the tournament, but is by no means guaranteed to finish it.</p> <p>All of which has unfolded against the backdrop of a certain cautious optimism, with the emphasis on caution. This is perhaps the first tournament for a generation where Germans are bearish rather than bullish on their chances: analogous in many ways to England in 2018, driven to cynicism by one too many tournament fiascos.</p> <p>The fervour and focus of a home crowd can drive teams to places they never thought they could go, make them feel irresistible, make opponents feel peripheral. In a tournament stacked with contenders, Germany will need&nbsp;that&nbsp;surge of sentiment to push them&nbsp;over the line. Friday night offers their first chance – and perhaps their last – to convert doubters into believers.</p>\n",

Like Karani, who was born in Germany, most Turkish Germans trace their ancestry to the <em>Gastarbeiter</em> (guest worker) movement of the 1960s and 70s.</p> <p>As a result, after the host nation Germany, no other European Championship participant will receive as much support as Turkey. The elation with which the Turkish national team was greeted last week during its public training session at its base in Barsinghausen, Lower Saxony, gave something of a foretaste of the reception the team is likely to receive in Dortmund on Tuesday evening, followed four days later there against Portugal and on 26 June against the Czech Republic in Hamburg.</p> <p>Some who failed to get tickets clambered up into the tree tops hoping for a glance into the training ground. They cheered Vincenzo Montella’s team with flags, homemade placards and cries of “Türkiye, Türkiye”. Many were already in national team kit or wore the shirts of their favourite Istanbul clubs. They hovered on the sidelines hoping for autographs or selfies with the stars, such as Real Madrid’s Arda Guler, Borussia Dortmund’s Salih Ozcan and the captain, Hakan Calhanoglu.</p>    <p>“We really feel at home when we’re in Germany,” the attacking midfielder, Yusuf Yazici, told journalists on the sidelines. “It’s like having your nation accompany you, such was the enthusiasm, and we’re all very happy to see them wherever we go.”</p> <p>Ozgur Ozvatan, a political scientist and sociologist at the Berlin Institute for Empirical Research on Integration and Migration says a <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/match/_/gameId/688956/turkey-germany\">friendly between Turkey and Germany</a> last November showed just how much potential there is for the Turkish fan scene to be politicised, driven in no small part by the nationalist momentum behind Turkey’s president Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who was visiting Germany at the time. But he says, around this championship, there is much to suggest that pure unalloyed emotion is the factor motivating most fans.</p> <p>“If you look at the sense of delight, it seems to be something that is less political and rather more to do with joy and euphoria that the Turkish national team is in Germany, and that those who support Turkey in Germany have the feeling that they are the hosts for this national team,” he said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/jun/14/euro-2024-team-guides-part-24-turkey\">Euro 2024 team guides part 24: Turkey</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Tugsal Mogul, theatre director, anaesthetist and football fan, who has supported Borussia Mönchengladbach all his life, has brought to the stage his mixed feelings about the internal strife he has often felt when urged to support either Turkey or Germany. <em><a href=\"https://staatstheater-hannover.de/de_DE/programm/unsere-elf.1343726\">Unsere Elf</a></em> (Our Eleven – A Somewhat Alternative National Anthem), which is playing at Hanover’s Staatstheater as part of the cultural programme around the Euros, explores racism, integration, migration and right-wing extremism, issues that have often been inextricably tied up with the game.</p> <p>As a child of Turkish migrants who was born in Germany’s industrial heartland of North Rhein Westphalia, Mogul says he often felt at a distance from Germany’s national team. “For years I wanted Germany to lose,” he said. “I was born here, my mother tongue is German, but I just could not identify with this team for a very long time.”</p> <p>The so-called <em>Sommermärchen</em> (summer fairytale) of 2006, when Germany hosted the World Cup and for a few short weeks, all seemed well with the world, was an experience he shared, but only to a certain extent. “It was the best of summers. I very much warmed to the German team. It was more diverse, more different than it had ever been. Sports-wise also on another level,” Mogul says.</p> <p>But it was also the height of what were initially dismissed as the “Kebab murders”, a string of racist killings by a neo-Nazi terrorist group, the NSU, the main targets of which were ethnic Turks, but who were long under suspicion by authorities of having carried out the attacks among themselves. “This image of the <em>Sommermärchen</em>, of a perfect world, a land without racism – it wasn’t quite correct. I remember seeing all the Germany flags at the windows, and feeling both appalled and happy,” he said.</p> <p>By 2014, captivated by none other than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/nov/15/mesut-ozil-turkish-german-football\">Mesut Özil</a>, “his legs, his style of play,” Mogul brought his first Germany shirt. “In Turkey,” he says with a chuckle. That dream also famously <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/mar/24/an-ode-to-mesut-ozil-the-frictionless-footballer-not-designed-for-the-age-of-rage\">turned sour</a>. Özil, widely considered one of Germany’s best players, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jul/22/mesut-ozil-retires-german-national-team-discrimination\">resigned from the national team</a> in 2018 citing discrimination, stating: “I am German when we win, but I am an immigrant when we lose”. In some ways the affair still overshadows the national team and to this day calls into question its claim to be a motor for integration.</p>    <p>Ozvatan, the political scientist, himself a former professional footballer, said that while he believed Özil was responsible for his own views, the German football federation (DFB) did not do itself proud in the way it dealt with his claim. He also talked about a poll from the recent <a href=\"https://presse.wdr.de/plounge/wdr/programm/2024/06/20240602_einigkeit_recht_vielfalt.html\">documentary by Philipp Awounou</a>, in which 21% of respondents said they agreed with the statement: “I would prefer it if more white players played in the German national team again”.</p> <p>“The reaction of the national team coach [Julian Nagelsmann] was to say: it was a shit poll, instead of saying: ‘This is a problem in Germany and we need to deal with it,’” Ozvatan says. “But these things cannot just be brushed under the carpet”.</p> <p>Mogul said despite some strife, there is much to be proud of in both Turkey and Germany’s teams, including Ilkay Gundogan, the grandson of a Turkish <em>gastarbeiter</em>, captaining the German team. For the opening game the TV camera seemed to linger on him a little longer than on anyone else, perhaps to see if he knew the words of the national anthem. (He did.)</p> <p>On the Kurfürstendamm boulevard, following Germany’s 5-1 win against Scotland on Friday night, a group of young German-Turks stood on the side of the road cheering as a constant stream of cars bearing German flags drove by, honking their horns in celebration. “We’re really happy that Germany won,” Adem, 18, said. “And I would also like to feel the same warmth from the Germans towards Turkey if and when we win.”</p>\n",

Of course you are. It’s been 13 long summer days since Real Madrid won the Champions League final, but the wait is almost over. We’re about to break the seal on a 30-day football buffet, where the games and goals will just keep piling up. You tell yourself that you <em>might</em> skip Poland v Austria next Friday, but you know you won’t.</p> <p>We’re all in, and if the trophy belongs to the players and the tournament belongs to the fans who will criss-cross between Germany’s great football cathedrals, then maybe this moment belongs to us, the armchair fans. The simple joy of a big summer tournament feels like an increasingly rare treat, so let’s savour the moment.</p> <p>Tonight’s opener, pencilled in the diary ever since the draw in early December, feels like a perfect first act. It pits the hosts, among the favourites but still not quite finding that elusive extra gear, against perennial underdogs in Scotland. Steve Clarke’s side appear to have slipped backwards since their exceptional qualifying campaign, drifting from dark horses to outsiders in a tricky Group A.</p> <p>That said, if you have to play Germany in Germany, this is the time to do it – when rustiness and first-night nerves could really play a part. All the pressure is on the hosts tonight, and the longer Scotland can keep them at bay, the greater the tension inside the, er, Munich Football Arena. There lies the path to a shock victory – and if you can’t dream now, when can you?</p> <p>Kick-off is at 9pm local time, 8pm BST and we’ll have all the buildup, team news and coverage of the opening ceremony. <em>Auf geht’s!</em></p> </div>   </div>\n",
      "<h2><strong>WE WON’T EVEN MENTION THAT TV CLIP</strong></h2> <p>Write off the Germans. They say you should never do it, but we just have because today Euro 2024 Daily is channeling its inner William Wallace and is – for one day only – happy to do so. In the run-up to Friday’s eagerly awaited curtain-raiser between the hosts and Steve Clarke’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/jun/14/fear-of-missing-out-scotland-fans-arrive-munich\">travelling Tartan Army</a>, you find us buzzing on Buckie and basking in the sense of enormous wellbeing generated by the sight and screeching sounds of that bevvied-up pipe and drum band who went viral courtesy of their march on Munich’s Marienplatz from Odeonsplatz on Thursday. OK, so they may not have been as viewed as often as that tired and emotional lone bagpiper who went bahoochie-over-brogues off the edge of a München restaurant booth without so much as missing a note as he crashed down, but if the team can maintain similar composure in the face of extreme adversity, who’s to say they won’t get a result?</p> <p>The omens are good. Or bad, depending on your point of view. In the 11 major tournaments they have – and Euro 2024 Daily uses this term advisedly – <em>contested</em>, Scotland have won just three times. One of those came against the footballing stronghold of New Zealand, while the others were at the expense of Yugoslavia and Zaire, two nations of whom our younger reader may genuinely never have heard. Scotland have also failed to win any of their opening games in any of their last six tournaments, while the most recent Scottish international to score a goal at a major competition on foreign soil <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/jun/12/craig-burley-warns-scotland-before-euro-2024-opener\">is Craig Burley</a>, who is aged 52. What’s more, in five competitive matches against Germany, Scotland have never won once, so while a pessimist might point out that both history and the odds <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/jun/13/we-have-everything-nagelsmann-talks-up-germany-before-scotland-opener\">are stacked against them</a>, someone who views their glass of Irn-Bru as being more half-full would argue that their time has finally come.</p> <p>In what is ostensibly a free hit for Clarke’s side before far easier – but still difficult – assignments to come, any kind of positive result would provide a rock-solid platform from which Scotland could subsequently catapult themselves into the knockout stages of a major tournament <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/jun/13/scotland-get-serious-as-steve-clarkes-men-eye-their-chance-to-make-history\">for the first time in their history</a>. “We want to make history,” <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/jun/13/prospect-of-becoming-legends-drives-us-says-scotlands-andy-robertson\">roared Andy Robertson</a>, who will lead his side into battle. “We have so many incentives here, but becoming a legendary squad is the biggest. That’s what has to drive us forward. The thought of being the first Scotland team to make a knockout round is our driving force. If we manage that? You just never know.”</p> <p>Well, you have a pretty good idea, but now is not the time to dwell on negatives, not least when everybody’s favourite fitba pundit, Ally McCoist, is brimful of optimism after getting his monster riffola on in the mosh pit of AC/DC’s gig at Munich’s Olympiastadion on Tuesday night. “The Germany game is a great game for us because it’s the opening game,” he tooted on TalkSport. “Germany have obviously had a bit of form and 100% they’ll be deservedly favourites – but it’s a good game for us to open with.” Top of the bill alongside Germany for Friday’s showdown at the Allianz Arena [Munich Football Arena, actually – Uefa Lawyers]<em>,</em> a win for Scotland would give them the momentum of a Rock N Roll Train and guarantee that their boisterous and good-humoured travelling fans shake the Bavarian capital all night long.</p> <h2><strong>LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE</strong></h2> <p>Join Niall McVeigh from 6pm for hot coverage of the Euro 2024 opening ceremony, followed by minute-by-minute updates from Germany 0-0 Scotland.</p> <h2><strong>QUOTE OF THE DAY</strong></h2> <p>“It started as a joke – hang a ball sprayed with text in a tree.

I was quite persuaded by your analysis that none of the participants will hoist the trophy.

The trouble with these things is that the choices are too limited: rather than just two bowls of food or whatever, there should be 24, weighted according to the probability of success. So France, at betting odds of 4-1, get a quarter-size bowl, while Albania at 500-1 get, er, one 500th of a bowl. Unfortunately that will make some bowls rather too small to see; we’ll need something with good eyesight – say, an osprey, or a bald eagle? The orangutan can be shifted on to UK general election duties, which looks somewhat easier to predict” – Charles Antaki.</p> </blockquote> <p><em>Send letters to <a href=\"mailto:the.boss@theguardian.com?utm_term=665dcebdaf7c30f2df2b72f8f4b694f2&amp;utm_campaign=TheFiver&amp;utm_source=esp&amp;utm_medium=Email&amp;CMP=fiver_email&amp;utm_term=665f315548bfde39636df5e04692c01d&amp;utm_campaign=TheFiver&amp;utm_source=esp&amp;utm_medium=Email&amp;CMP=fiver_email&amp;utm_term=666080f73692ab47041ba59b8dd2163f&amp;utm_campaign=TheFiver&amp;utm_source=esp&amp;utm_medium=Email&amp;CMP=fiver_email&amp;utm_term=66631bc31ecb59738269c2977414484f&amp;utm_campaign=TheFiver&amp;utm_source=esp&amp;utm_medium=Email&amp;CMP=fiver_email\">the.boss@theguardian.com</a>. <strong>Today’s letter o’ the day winner is … Charles Antaki, who wins our final copy of <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Euro-88-Football-European-Championship/dp/1801507201\">Euro 88: The Football Purists’ European Championship</a>, by Pitch Publishing.

      "<p>Sometimes, in an effort to mix things up towards the end of Germany’s training sessions, Julian Nagelsmann cooks up a clash of generations. The more youthful half of his unit contest a match against their seniors and it is, in the manager’s words, “always a hard fight”. Neither team consistently holds sway over the other and any battle lines are purely cosmetic. “To have a good mix is really positive,” he said. “The mood in our camp is excellent and the connection between the younger and older players is really good.”</p> <p>Germany’s blend clicked <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/jun/15/kai-havertz-more-to-come-euro-2024-germany-scotland\">to delightful effect against Scotland</a>. Their youngest players, the 21-year-olds Jamal Musiala and Florian Wirtz, scored fine goals and&nbsp;were given their platform by&nbsp;an experienced base like no other. Given their speed and verve it is a surprise to note that Germany have the highest average age at Euro&nbsp;2024; it is even more of an eye-opener that, should they lift the trophy in Berlin next month, they will be the oldest European champions in the tournament’s&nbsp;history.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/jun/18/turkey-georgia-euro-2024-group-f-match-report\">Arda Guler brings the thunder as Turkey survive storm to beat Georgia</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“We have to find some solutions for the future,” Nagelsmann said, clearly aware that the present finely balanced setup will probably not even survive into the next World Cup. “But for the tournament we’re in now, it’s the perfect mix and we can be very successful.”</p> <p>A win against Hungary in Stuttgart, guaranteeing a place in the last 16 with a game to spare, would heighten that impression. Nagelsmann will name the same side that thrashed Scotland: why tinker when, bar a freakish own goal from Antonio Rüdiger, their performance had been virtually perfect? The spine will comprise four thirtysomethings: Rüdiger, Manuel Neuer, Toni Kroos and Ilkay Gündogan have 378 caps between them and a depth of understanding honed over more than a decade.</p> <p>“I can vouch for our players who already have a three in front [of their age],” Neuer joked on Monday. He is 38 and, like Kroos, is back on the scene after an extended absence. Germany’s veterans are not unscarred by recent failures but most of them know how it feels to have the world at their feet.</p> <p>“They have all experienced solutions for different situations, especially when you talk about pressure and expectations, on and off the pitch,” Nagelsmann said.</p>    <p>Watching Kroos run the show against Scotland it was hard not to feel helpless that such an extraordinary talent will retire this&nbsp;summer while seemingly at the top of his game. Perhaps Kroos, whose gifts can fly beneath the radar amid Real Madrid’s razzmatazz, will receive the tributes he deserves when this competition has finished. “He’s still one of the top three players in the world at finding teammates between the lines, creating chances and setting up goals,” Nagelsmann said. “And I think he’ll do that tomorrow as well.”</p> <p>If Hungary begin as they did in an underwhelming <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/jun/15/hungary-switzerland-euro-2024-match-report\">defeat by Switzerland</a>, when they were alarmingly open in the first half, Kroos and Gündogan may pick them apart. Nagelsmann was keen to stress that Marco Rossi’s team had improved significantly after the interval, talking up their threat from crosses and set pieces. He will also be aware that Hungary have established some kind of hold over the host nation of late. They won a Nations League match in Leipzig before Qatar 2022 and forced a 2-2 draw in a gloriously chaotic group‑stage match at Euro 2020.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2024/05/mens-euros-players/embed/germany/1/player.html\" data-alt=\"Manuel Neuer profile\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2024/05/mens-euros-players/embed/germany/1/player.html\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>But Germany exude certainty now. The captain Gündogan, who is serious about his role as on‑pitch mentor to Wirtz and Musiala, was illuminating in spelling out the difference Nagelsmann has made. “It helped us a lot that the coach defined a clear role,” he said. “That helped us a lot, especially after the negative experiences of the last tournaments. There is clarity among the team, also because the coach exudes security.”</p> <p>Discipline away from the pitch will also be in focus before a match that has been deemed a high security risk. Up to 20,000 Hungary fans are expected to attend and the police presence will extend to more than 2,500 officers. A range of measures will be implemented to keep large groups of opposing supporters separate.</p> <p>Hungary hope a continuation of their form against the Germans will be the headline. A defeat would leave them on the brink of elimination and Rossi struck a pragmatic note. “In my opinion Germany are the toughest team to play against right now,” he said “We will do our very best. We know the German team is better than us. We can say this and nobody needs to take offence – it can motivate us. We can give it our best shot. Hopefully we can grasp a point and that will give us a chance to qualify.”</p> <p>Nagelsmann, who allowed his players free time with their families after the Scotland game, hopes to keep the good feeling going. “I hope I prepared them well,” he said.</p> <p>The benefits of those age-based practice games are there to be reaped once more.</p>\n",
      "<p>The Hungary manager, Marco Rossi, accused the referee Danny Makkelie of a “double standard” after a controversial Jamal Musiala goal was allowed to stand in their 2-0 defeat by Germany.</p> <p>Rossi and his players were furious that Ilkay Gündogan was not pulled up, either by Makkelie or VAR, in the buildup for what they felt was a shove on the centre-back Willi Orban. In truth contact had been light and, on balance, the decision seemed correct. But it set Hungary on the way to a defeat that leaves their participation beyond the group stage at Euro 2024 in grave doubt and Rossi pondered whether bigger-name sides might have been treated differently.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/jun/19/germany-hungary-euro-2024-group-a-match-report\">Musiala and Gündogan shine as Germany ease to win against Hungary</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“What the referee did tonight, it’s a double standard,” said Rossi, citing an incident in the second half when the Germany midfielder Robert Andrich tumbled in his own box and was given a foul. “From my perspective Germany would have won anyway, they’re stronger than us, but the referee was the worst on the pitch.</p> <p>“Germany didn’t need help from the referee, especially against a team like Hungary. When they play against someone like France, let’s see if a foul will be given or not.”</p> <p>Hungary, who have two defeats from two, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/jun/19/scotland-switzerland-euro-2024-group-a-match-report\">must beat Scotland</a> to have any chance of a place in the last 16. “We will try everything to win,” Rossi said. “Our fans want to see on the pitch that we are spitting blood. I don’t ask our guys to win, to score goals. I just ask them to give their maximum.”</p> <p>Gündogan had a different view of the opener. “I was quite surprised that the Hungarian player and his teammates were angry about it,” he said. “I don’t know what it looked like on TV but I played in the Premier League for seven years and if you gave that in the Premier League as a foul I think everyone would have been laughing on the floor.”</p> <p>Julian Nagelsmann, whose team have reached the knockout stage with a game to spare, urged Germany to finish the job by topping Group A. “We want to be first in our group and then we will see,” he said. “For today I’m happy with the result. It was a tough game and we’ve qualified.”</p>\n",
      "<p>Which of Germany’s old stagers will be next to steal the scene? Toni Kroos had teased Scotland to pieces on the opening day but this time the floor was left to his captain, who delivered a resounding statement. Four months from now Ilkay Gündogan will turn 34 but this was another of those evenings where, as with his imminently retiring colleague, the idea that the show will one day end feels simply unfair.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/jun/19/hungarys-marco-rossi-accuses-referee-of-double-standard-after-germany-loss\">Hungary’s Marco Rossi accuses referee of ‘double standard’ after Germany loss</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Gündogan intervened decisively midway through each half, creating the opener for Jamal Musiala and sweeping in a second goal that finally deflated a largely impressive Hungary. Had Marco Rossi’s players converted one presentable chance among several, notably through Barnabas Varga on the hour, they would have quietened a buoyant crowd. Instead they were the latest to find that the hosts have begun this summer with the dead-eyed edge of old. Germany were clinical and their momentum is gathering.</p> <p>If the veterans are trading star billing, Musiala is a dazzling constant. “The way he’s going right now, he can be one of the best,” Gündogan said afterwards and it was justified praise. He turned in another irrepressible performance and what a special moment it was when, in his home city, he met the captain’s pass and hammered high into the net. Musiala tormented Hungary out wide but his acuity in occupying pockets of space more centrally was fundamental to the moments that won this game.</p> <p>Exhibit A came in the 22nd minute of a game Germany had started slowly, finding that Hungary were as good as their word in promising a more aggressive display than in a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/jun/15/hungary-switzerland-euro-2024-match-report\">poor defeat against Switzerland</a>. Some of the hosts’ connections around the box had started to show promise, and Peter Gulascsi had saved from Kai Havertz after ineffectual defending from Willi Orban, but it took Musiala’s initiative to calm their early jitters.</p>    <p>Musiala had collected the ball in a tight space on the edge of the box, with four opponents looking to minimise his options, and slipped it through to an on-rushing Gündogan. There was a sizeable element of fortune after that, the pass bouncing off his thigh as he sought to tame it and seemingly allowing Orban to take control.</p> <p>The centre-back, no more convincing than he had been earlier on, stumbled as he tried to shepherd the ball towards the byline. The complaint was that Gündogan had shoved him, but Orban had seemed to lean into his opponent and surely should have been stronger. Several of Hungary’s players certainly erred in stopping with hands held aloft while the midfielder took control of matters and, from the left side of the six‑yard box, teed up an alert Musiala for a second thudding finish in as many games.</p> <p>Hungary had come close after only 16 seconds, Manuel Neuer diving at the feet of Roland Sallai, and gave the 38-year-old more to do. They did not appear perturbed at going behind and were denied soon afterwards when Neuer brilliantly repelled a Dominik Szoboszlai free-kick and blocked the rebound from Varga. If the excellence of golden oldies is to be a theme, Neuer was another who warmed to it.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/jun/19/scotland-switzerland-euro-2024-group-a-match-report\">Scotland keep knockout hopes alive after battling draw with Switzerland</a> </p> </aside>  <p>By the three-quarter mark Germany had not put Hungary, who had recorded a win and two draws in their previous three meetings, out of view. Then Kroos sped up a prolonged passing move with a first-time clip to Musiala, imbued with instructions to maintain that raised tempo. Eyes in the back of his head, Musiala found the left‑back Maximilian Mittelstädt in space and the resulting cutback was swept in by Gündogan.</p> <p>He barely put a foot wrong throughout and Julian Nagelsmann pointed out that, off the ball, he had kept Germany on the straight and narrow when they were listing. “He worked amazingly,” Nagelsmann said. “He tried to steer the match, he used some of the stoppages and tried to double check things with me. I have big trust in him because I know what is within him.”</p> <p>Perhaps the post-match enthusiasm would have been more restrained if Varga, unmarked from a perfect Sallai cross, had equalised rather than looping his header over. There was little influence Gundogan could exert on that sequence. Sallai had a goal correctly disallowed before the interval and, towards the end, a late goalline clearance from Joshua Kimmich ensured the bank of almost 20,000 fans behind Neuer’s goal were left with nothing bar an improved showing to savour. Hungary, fancied as potential dark horses, are on the brink of elimination.</p> <p>For Germany the latter stages were celebratory and Nagelsmann could play to the gallery by enhancing the local flavour. Mittelstadt, who plays here for VfB Stuttgart, was joined on the pitch by clubmates Chris Fuhrich and the Brighton loanee Deniz Undav; the crowd loved those little touches, just as they had adored those of Gundogan and his cohort.</p>\n",

Like Karani, who was born in Germany, most Turkish Germans trace their ancestry to the <em>Gastarbeiter</em> (guest worker) movement of the 1960s and 70s.</p> <p>As a result, after the host nation Germany, no other European Championship participant will receive as much support as Turkey. The elation with which the Turkish national team was greeted last week during its public training session at its base in Barsinghausen, Lower Saxony, gave something of a foretaste of the reception the team is likely to receive in Dortmund on Tuesday evening, followed four days later there against Portugal and on 26 June against the Czech Republic in Hamburg.</p> <p>Some who failed to get tickets clambered up into the tree tops hoping for a glance into the training ground. They cheered Vincenzo Montella’s team with flags, homemade placards and cries of “Türkiye, Türkiye”. Many were already in national team kit or wore the shirts of their favourite Istanbul clubs. They hovered on the sidelines hoping for autographs or selfies with the stars, such as Real Madrid’s Arda Guler, Borussia Dortmund’s Salih Ozcan and the captain, Hakan Calhanoglu.</p>    <p>“We really feel at home when we’re in Germany,” the attacking midfielder, Yusuf Yazici, told journalists on the sidelines. “It’s like having your nation accompany you, such was the enthusiasm, and we’re all very happy to see them wherever we go.”</p> <p>Ozgur Ozvatan, a political scientist and sociologist at the Berlin Institute for Empirical Research on Integration and Migration says a <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/match/_/gameId/688956/turkey-germany\">friendly between Turkey and Germany</a> last November showed just how much potential there is for the Turkish fan scene to be politicised, driven in no small part by the nationalist momentum behind Turkey’s president Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who was visiting Germany at the time. But he says, around this championship, there is much to suggest that pure unalloyed emotion is the factor motivating most fans.</p> <p>“If you look at the sense of delight, it seems to be something that is less political and rather more to do with joy and euphoria that the Turkish national team is in Germany, and that those who support Turkey in Germany have the feeling that they are the hosts for this national team,” he said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/jun/14/euro-2024-team-guides-part-24-turkey\">Euro 2024 team guides part 24: Turkey</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Tugsal Mogul, theatre director, anaesthetist and football fan, who has supported Borussia Mönchengladbach all his life, has brought to the stage his mixed feelings about the internal strife he has often felt when urged to support either Turkey or Germany. <em><a href=\"https://staatstheater-hannover.de/de_DE/programm/unsere-elf.1343726\">Unsere Elf</a></em> (Our Eleven – A Somewhat Alternative National Anthem), which is playing at Hanover’s Staatstheater as part of the cultural programme around the Euros, explores racism, integration, migration and right-wing extremism, issues that have often been inextricably tied up with the game.</p> <p>As a child of Turkish migrants who was born in Germany’s industrial heartland of North Rhein Westphalia, Mogul says he often felt at a distance from Germany’s national team. “For years I wanted Germany to lose,” he said. “I was born here, my mother tongue is German, but I just could not identify with this team for a very long time.”</p> <p>The so-called <em>Sommermärchen</em> (summer fairytale) of 2006, when Germany hosted the World Cup and for a few short weeks, all seemed well with the world, was an experience he shared, but only to a certain extent. “It was the best of summers. I very much warmed to the German team. It was more diverse, more different than it had ever been. Sports-wise also on another level,” Mogul says.</p> <p>But it was also the height of what were initially dismissed as the “Kebab murders”, a string of racist killings by a neo-Nazi terrorist group, the NSU, the main targets of which were ethnic Turks, but who were long under suspicion by authorities of having carried out the attacks among themselves. “This image of the <em>Sommermärchen</em>, of a perfect world, a land without racism – it wasn’t quite correct. I remember seeing all the Germany flags at the windows, and feeling both appalled and happy,” he said.</p> <p>By 2014, captivated by none other than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/nov/15/mesut-ozil-turkish-german-football\">Mesut Özil</a>, “his legs, his style of play,” Mogul brought his first Germany shirt. “In Turkey,” he says with a chuckle. That dream also famously <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/mar/24/an-ode-to-mesut-ozil-the-frictionless-footballer-not-designed-for-the-age-of-rage\">turned sour</a>. Özil, widely considered one of Germany’s best players, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jul/22/mesut-ozil-retires-german-national-team-discrimination\">resigned from the national team</a> in 2018 citing discrimination, stating: “I am German when we win, but I am an immigrant when we lose”. In some ways the affair still overshadows the national team and to this day calls into question its claim to be a motor for integration.</p>    <p>Ozvatan, the political scientist, himself a former professional footballer, said that while he believed Özil was responsible for his own views, the German football federation (DFB) did not do itself proud in the way it dealt with his claim. He also talked about a poll from the recent <a href=\"https://presse.wdr.de/plounge/wdr/programm/2024/06/20240602_einigkeit_recht_vielfalt.html\">documentary by Philipp Awounou</a>, in which 21% of respondents said they agreed with the statement: “I would prefer it if more white players played in the German national team again”.</p> <p>“The reaction of the national team coach [Julian Nagelsmann] was to say: it was a shit poll, instead of saying: ‘This is a problem in Germany and we need to deal with it,’” Ozvatan says. “But these things cannot just be brushed under the carpet”.</p> <p>Mogul said despite some strife, there is much to be proud of in both Turkey and Germany’s teams, including Ilkay Gundogan, the grandson of a Turkish <em>gastarbeiter</em>, captaining the German team. For the opening game the TV camera seemed to linger on him a little longer than on anyone else, perhaps to see if he knew the words of the national anthem. (He did.)</p> <p>On the Kurfürstendamm boulevard, following Germany’s 5-1 win against Scotland on Friday night, a group of young German-Turks stood on the side of the road cheering as a constant stream of cars bearing German flags drove by, honking their horns in celebration. “We’re really happy that Germany won,” Adem, 18, said. “And I would also like to feel the same warmth from the Germans towards Turkey if and when we win.”</p>',\n",

Only job was to retrieve the ball after late consolation. <strong>6</strong></p> <p><strong>Joshua Kimmich </strong>Clever pass to Wirtz set rout in motion. Able to enjoy himself on ball with little defending required. <strong>8</strong></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/jun/14/germany-scotland-euro-2024-match-report\">Germany kickstart Euro 2024 in style and pile on the pain for 10-man Scotland </a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>Antonio Rüdiger </strong>Purred through his night’s work until McKenna’s header deflected off him for a freakish own goal. <strong>7</strong></p> <p><strong>Jonathan Tah </strong>Put under no pressure whatsoever, so may be disappointed to leave with booking hanging over him. <strong>7</strong></p> <p><strong>Max</strong><strong>imilian</strong><strong> Mittelstädt </strong>Good tournament debut from left-back, who used the ball intelligently to create space for his wingers. <strong>7</strong></p> <p><strong>Robert Andrich </strong>Steely presence in a lineup laced with silk. Withdrawn at break, presumably to avoid a second booking. <strong>7</strong></p> <p><strong>Toni Kroos </strong>Ran proceedings with a majestic display, including sumptuous diagonal in move for Wirtz’s goal. His return could make the difference for Germany. <strong>9</strong></p>    <p><strong>Jamal Musiala </strong>Smart footwork and thumping finish epitomised a mesmerising display. Almost impossible to dispossess in full flight. <strong>9</strong></p> <p><strong>Ilkay Gündogan </strong>Turn and slide-rule ball to Havertz before second goal were breathtaking. Deft, masterful night’s work from the Germany captain. <strong>8</strong></p> <p><strong>Florian Wirtz </strong>Wunderkind announced himself with snapshot that outfoxed Gunn. Clever, darting menace and could have scored again. <strong>8</strong></p> <p><strong>Kai Havertz </strong>Looked the part leading Germany’s line. Composed assist for Musiala and, never looked like fluffing the penalty. <strong>8</strong></p> <p><strong>Substitutes</strong> Gross (for Andrich ht) <strong>7</strong>, Füllkrug (for Havertz 63), <strong>8</strong>, Sané (for Wirtz 63) <strong>7</strong>, Müller (for Musiala 74) <strong>7</strong>, Can&nbsp;(for&nbsp;Kroos 80) <strong>8</strong></p> <h2><strong>Scotland (3-4-2-1)</strong></h2> <p><strong>Angus Gunn </strong>Had to do better for the opener, which ruined any chance of a foothold. Avoided further calamities but the damage was already done. <strong>5</strong></p> <p><strong>Ryan Porteous </strong>Could have no complaints about red card for diabolical challenge on Gündogan. Largely tied in knots until then. <strong>4</strong></p> <p><strong>Jack Hendry </strong>A few blocks but looked cumbersome against an attack that pulled the backline around at will. <strong>4</strong></p> <p><strong>Kieran Tierney </strong>Tried to build attacks from left centre-back berth but ball kept coming back at Scotland. Germany’s movement was too much. <strong>5</strong></p>    <p><strong>Anthony Ralston </strong>Looked out of his depth against Germany’s wide men. Beaten repeatedly and could not make any impact going forward. <strong>4</strong></p> <p><strong>Scott McTominay </strong>Never stood a chance of outplaying home schemers but failed to outmuscle them either in a game that passed him by. <strong>5</strong></p> <p><strong>Callum McGregor </strong>Could not get near the hosts’ midfield and struggled in particular against Gündogan’s speed of thought. <strong>4</strong></p> <p><strong>Andy Robertson </strong>Skipper delivered free-kick that brought consolation but was given torrid time by Musiala and Wirtz before break. <strong>5</strong></p> <p><strong>Ryan Christie </strong>Ran around gamely, and occupied nominally advanced role after break, but never a sniff of making something happen. <strong>5</strong></p> <p><strong>John McGinn </strong>Needed to justify star billing but too ponderous on rare occasions he had a chance to use \\xadthe&nbsp;ball. <strong>4</strong></p> <p><strong>Ché Adams </strong>Most thankless of tasks for the striker, who barely had a kick. Replaced by defender Hanley at interval. <strong>5</strong></p> <p><strong>Substitutes</strong> Hanley (for Adams ht) <strong>6</strong>, Gilmour (for McGregor 67) <strong>5</strong>, McLean (for McGinn 67) <strong>5</strong>, McKenna (for Tierney 77) <strong>6</strong>, Shankland (for Christie 82) <strong>5</strong></p>',\n",

Of course you are. It’s been 13 long summer days since Real Madrid won the Champions League final, but the wait is almost over. We’re about to break the seal on a 30-day football buffet, where the games and goals will just keep piling up. You tell yourself that you <em>might</em> skip Poland v Austria next Friday, but you know you won’t.</p> <p>We’re all in, and if the trophy belongs to the players and the tournament belongs to the fans who will criss-cross between Germany’s great football cathedrals, then maybe this moment belongs to us, the armchair fans. The simple joy of a big summer tournament feels like an increasingly rare treat, so let’s savour the moment.</p> <p>Tonight’s opener, pencilled in the diary ever since the draw in early December, feels like a perfect first act. It pits the hosts, among the favourites but still not quite finding that elusive extra gear, against perennial underdogs in Scotland. Steve Clarke’s side appear to have slipped backwards since their exceptional qualifying campaign, drifting from dark horses to outsiders in a tricky Group A.</p> <p>That said, if you have to play Germany in Germany, this is the time to do it – when rustiness and first-night nerves could really play a part. All the pressure is on the hosts tonight, and the longer Scotland can keep them at bay, the greater the tension inside the, er, Munich Football Arena. There lies the path to a shock victory – and if you can’t dream now, when can you?</p> <p>Kick-off is at 9pm local time, 8pm BST and we’ll have all the buildup, team news and coverage of the opening ceremony. <em>Auf geht’s!</em></p> </div>   </div>',\n",

       "'<p>If only the Germans had a word for “zeitgeist”. There’s a football tournament starting here on Friday, not that you would necessarily know it. Indeed, from a cursory trawl of Thursday’s media what was most striking of all was the absence of Euros-buzz, the suspicion that there are bigger priorities out there. “CANCER,” screamed the front page of <em>Bild</em>, just in case you were thinking of getting too excited. Chancellor Olaf Scholz is missing the opening game to attend the G7 in Italy. The sports bulletins were dominated by the sudden resignation of the Borussia Dortmund coach, Edin Terzic. On the Kicker website, the first Euro 2024 news appeared some way below a story about RB Leipzig’s summer transfer business.</p> <p>None of which should necessarily be mistaken for pure apathy. Rather, there is a more complex melange of emotions at work here. Euro 2024 is still very much present, as long as you know where to look: the big town squares where overseas fans have begun to congregate, the television ad breaks where Joshua Kimmich is shaving his chin baby-smooth with a next-generation razor. Tickets for Germany’s open training session in Jena sold out in 10 minutes.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/jun/13/we-have-everything-nagelsmann-talks-up-germany-before-scotland-opener\">‘We have everything’: Nagelsmann talks up Germany before Scotland opener</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But, among the great unconverted, there remains a certain tactical restraint. This is a public burned by past failures, who pledge primary loyalty to their club teams, who above all are wary of overcommiting too early. When even the great Toni Kroos lists France, Portugal and England as his three favourites, with the host nation in the chase group just behind, the attempt at expectation management is clear enough. Germany is not all-in on this team yet. By 11pm on Friday night, that could very well have changed.</p> <p>Through history, Germany’s campaigns have often thrived or foundered on their opening game. Each of their seven previous tournament victories began with a win; indeed, Germany have never failed to reach the quarter-finals after winning their first game. Even now, Philipp Lahm is best remembered as the man whose curling shot against Costa Rica started the euphoria machine that was the 2006 World Cup.</p> <p>By contrast, each of Germany’s past three tournaments has begun with a momentum-crushing defeat: to Mexico in 2018, France in 2021 and Japan in 2022. Lose to Scotland in Munich on Friday, and all of a sudden Sommermärchen 2.0 will take on a vividly different shade. “The first match is very, very&nbsp;important,” Kroos said earlier this week. “The last few tournaments have shown that in a negative way.”</p>    <p>One of the ironies of Germany’s slump at international level over recent years is that it has coincided with a rich vein of form for German clubs in Europe. Bayern won the Champions League in 2020; Eintracht Frankfurt the Europa League in 2022; Borussia Dortmund made this year’s Champions League final; Bayer Leverkusen were the best team in the world for large parts of this season, surrendering their unbeaten record only in their penultimate game, the Europa League final against Atalanta.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the likes of Kroos, Antonio Rüdiger and Ilkay Gündogan have won practically everything there is to win at club level. Point being: this is a squad that knows how to rise to the big occasion. The issue, of late, has been doing so in tandem.</p> <p>But over the short invigorating months under Julian Nagelsmann, the pieces have slowly come together. Rüdiger and Jonathan Tah have forged a strong partnership at the heart of defence, solving one of Germany’s longstanding issues at a stroke. “It just works,” Rüdiger said recently. Kimmich at right-back will have the job of dealing with the overlapping Andrew Robertson. On the opposite flank Maximilian Mittelstädt, who has had a breakout&nbsp;season with Stuttgart, provides an underrated attacking threat of his&nbsp;own.</p> <p>Gündogan and Kroos, with Robert Andrich behind them, form a midfield to envy any in the tournament. The return of the all-conquering Kroos offers this team not just an unerring passing game and a champion mentality, but a certain sense of mission: an opportunity to elevate their teammate into the pantheon occupied by generational greats like&nbsp;Xavi, Andrés Iniesta and Zinedine Zidane who won everything there was to win, who essentially completed football. Then you have the front three, with&nbsp;Florian Wirtz and Jamal Musiala providing the creativity and Kai Havertz the cutting edge up front. Niclas Füllkrug, Leroy Sané and Thomas Müller are more likely to make an impact from the bench but could feature more extensively&nbsp;later.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/jun/13/germany-and-nagelsmann-still-trying-to-solve-their-ilkay-gundogan-puzzle\">Germany and Nagelsmann still trying to solve their Ilkay Gündogan puzzle</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This is, by any measure, a team capable of challenging. In fact, pretty much the only genuine selection dilemma for Nagelsmann is in what has traditionally been the strongest position of all. “We don’t need a discussion about our goalkeeper,” the sporting director, Rudi Völler, said this week. Yep, good luck with that. In reality the mistake by Manuel Neuer in the recent friendly against Greece – the latest in a string of errors by the 38-year-old – has reopened the debate over the No&nbsp;1 shirt. In any other era Marc-André ter Stegen would probably have 120 caps rather than the 40 he has managed to scrape together in Neuer’s shadow. Neuer will start the tournament, but is by no means guaranteed to finish it.</p> <p>All of which has unfolded against the backdrop of a certain cautious optimism, with the emphasis on caution. This is perhaps the first tournament for a generation where Germans are bearish rather than bullish on their chances: analogous in many ways to England in 2018, driven to cynicism by one too many tournament fiascos.</p> <p>The fervour and focus of a home crowd can drive teams to places they never thought they could go, make them feel irresistible, make opponents feel peripheral. In a tournament stacked with contenders, Germany will need&nbsp;that&nbsp;surge of sentiment to push them&nbsp;over the line. Friday night offers their first chance – and perhaps their last – to convert doubters into believers.</p>'"

On the Kicker website, the first Euro 2024 news appeared some way below a story about RB Leipzig’s summer transfer business. None of which should necessarily be mistaken for pure apathy. Rather, there is a more complex melange of emotions at work here. Euro 2024 is still very much present, as long as you know where to look: the big town squares where overseas fans have begun to congregate, the television ad breaks where Joshua Kimmich is shaving his chin baby-smooth with a next-generation razor. Tickets for Germany’s open training session in Jena sold out in 10 minutes.   Related: ‘We have everything’: Nagelsmann talks up Germany before Scotland opener   But, among the great unconverted, there remains a certain tactical restraint. This is a public burned by past failures, who pledge primary loyalty to their club teams, who above all are wary of overcommiting too early. When even the great Toni Kroos lists France, Portugal and England as his three favourites, with the host nation in the chase group just behind, the attempt at expectation management is clear enough. Germany is not all-in on this team yet. By 11pm on Friday night, that could very well have changed. Through history, Germany’s campaigns have often thrived or foundered on their opening game. Each of their seven previous tournament victories began with a win; indeed, Germany have never failed to reach the quarter-finals after winning their first game. Even now, Philipp Lahm is best remembered as the man whose curling shot against Costa Rica started the euphoria machine that was the 2006 World Cup. By contrast, each of Germany’s past three tournaments has begun with a momentum-crushing defeat: to Mexico in 2018, France in 2021 and Japan in 2022. Lose to Scotland in Munich on Friday, and all of a sudden Sommermärchen 2.0 will take on a vividly different shade. “The first match is very, very\\xa0important,” Kroos said earlier this week. “The last few tournaments have shown that in a negative way.” One of the ironies of Germany’s slump at international level over recent years is that it has coincided with a rich vein of form for German clubs in Europe. Bayern won the Champions League in 2020; Eintracht Frankfurt the Europa League in 2022; Borussia Dortmund made this year’s Champions League final; Bayer Leverkusen were the best team in the world for large parts of this season, surrendering their unbeaten record only in their penultimate game, the Europa League final against Atalanta. Meanwhile, the likes of Kroos, Antonio Rüdiger and Ilkay Gündogan have won practically everything there is to win at club level. Point being: this is a squad that knows how to rise to the big occasion. The issue, of late, has been doing so in tandem. But over the short invigorating months under Julian Nagelsmann, the pieces have slowly come together. Rüdiger and Jonathan Tah have forged a strong partnership at the heart of defence, solving one of Germany’s longstanding issues at a stroke. “It just works,” Rüdiger said recently. Kimmich at right-back will have the job of dealing with the overlapping Andrew Robertson. On the opposite flank Maximilian Mittelstädt, who has had a breakout\\xa0season with Stuttgart, provides an underrated attacking threat of his\\xa0own. Gündogan and Kroos, with Robert Andrich behind them, form a midfield to envy any in the tournament. The return of the all-conquering Kroos offers this team not just an unerring passing game and a champion mentality, but a certain sense of mission: an opportunity to elevate their teammate into the pantheon occupied by generational greats like\\xa0Xavi, Andrés Iniesta and Zinedine Zidane who won everything there was to win, who essentially completed football. Then you have the front three, with\\xa0Florian Wirtz and Jamal Musiala providing the creativity and Kai Havertz the cutting edge up front. Niclas Füllkrug, Leroy Sané and Thomas Müller are more likely to make an impact from the bench but could feature more extensively\\xa0later.   Related: Germany and Nagelsmann still trying to solve their Ilkay Gündogan puzzle   This is, by any measure, a team capable of challenging. In fact, pretty much the only genuine selection dilemma for Nagelsmann is in what has traditionally been the strongest position of all. “We don’t need a discussion about our goalkeeper,” the sporting director, Rudi Völler, said this week. Yep, good luck with that. In reality the mistake by Manuel Neuer in the recent friendly against Greece – the latest in a string of errors by the 38-year-old – has reopened the debate over the No\\xa01 shirt. In any other era Marc-André ter Stegen would probably have 120 caps rather than the 40 he has managed to scrape together in Neuer’s shadow. Neuer will start the tournament, but is by no means guaranteed to finish it. All of which has unfolded against the backdrop of a certain cautious optimism, with the emphasis on caution. This is perhaps the first tournament for a generation where Germans are bearish rather than bullish on their chances: analogous in many ways to England in 2018, driven to cynicism by one too many tournament fiascos. The fervour and focus of a home crowd can drive teams to places they never thought they could go, make them feel irresistible, make opponents feel peripheral. In a tournament stacked with contenders, Germany will need\\xa0that\\xa0surge of sentiment to push them\\xa0over the line. Friday night offers their first chance – and perhaps their last – to convert doubters into believers.'"
